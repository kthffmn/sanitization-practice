They may step around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly forward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be given from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling directors.

If you don`t do this the scene doesn`t form very good patterns and the players get too competitive. You also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to hook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to nrealize that they are being excluded. A good way to start this game would be: Start in a black-out seated round a table While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke) The lights slowly fade up as the cast`s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we usually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist Big thanks to Alan Marriott of Crunchy Frog Collective and Grand Theft Impro (London, England) for the additional info on Alliances."

Have the audience introduce themselves to strangers, tell a secret their spouse/partner doesn`t know about to a stranger, have them hug a stranger, tell your neighbor waht you ate today, your pin code Do an interview with the audience, where the MC is one character (say, a headmaster) and all of the audience another (say a naughty child). The audience needs to reply to the interview in one voice (all saying the same at the same time - see One Mouth ). Not an easy one, and if the audience does not feel like doing this it really sucks. When it works it`s a real thrill. divide the audience in 3 or 4 groups, and give each group a sound. Rehearse the sound with each group. Then tell a silly story, and use these sounds as sound effects. (We saw a pretty gruesome one in which one group was a car (roar), another a dog (bark) and the third group got a kind of splashing sound. The poor dog got run over by the car... not exactly nice but the audience had fun with it) Do a cheering competition between the men and the women. Rehearse different kinds of applause (from the `polite` applause when a scene sucks, over an `ooh` applause for a touching scene, to a wild roar for a hilarious scene). Have them rehearse voting for a team by cheering the team name (if that`s your format). Rehearse a `Die` ( see Die ) if i you`re going to be playing scenes in which the audience can decide to throw a player out of the game. Give the men and the women a different sound and play with that. Tell them they are members of a wild tribe, the women go `Ugh` when you raise your left hand and the man go `Hagawaga` when you raise your right hand."

Other possibilities are: Just say `bop` if anyone else reacts, that person becomes `it` Say `Elephant`, after which 3 players build the elephant: the player picked does the trunk (hold nose and squeeze your other arm through) and her neighbors do the ears. If any of the 3 players screws up or does not react he or she becomes it. Say `mixer`: the player in the middle becomes a mixer, holding arms up in the air, sort of horizontally, while her neighbors position themselves under her hands, and turn around their axises Say `toaster` : the player in the middle becomes a slice of bread, and her neighbors become the toaster, by `building` the toaster with their arms around the bread. The slice of bread pops up an down too when done! Feel free to invent other objects (suggestions can be found under Bippety Bop(1) )."

Player 1 agrees, but adds something like \"Whatever you do, don`t push the red button\". Player 2 begins to play with the buttons, controlling player 2. Then, we slowly work up to the use of the dreaded red button, which will make player 2 do something not-so-obvious. This can be anything, but it should not be preconceived. The red button might become a Mood swing button, a Start Screaming, Start Giggling, Sing Opera, or Switch-to- Gibberish button."

Third tap: all players, still eyes closed, and still associating, try to reconstruct the circle. Exercise is over when everyone is in a circle again.

So the person who begins (the one that knows whatâ\u0080\u0099s going on) will declare whoever talks first dead by saying \"youâ\u0080\u0099re dead\". That person isnâ\u0080\u0099t \"out\" or anything, itâ\u0080\u0099s just for effect. The game continues until the players catch on. If somebody thinks they get it, the leader gives them a chance to say the clicks and bangs and they get to announce who is dead; the leader will then be able to tell if they understand the secret if they announce the right person as being dead. Make sure that once the players begin to catch on, they donâ\u0080\u0099t spoil it for the others by letting the cat out of the bag. Also, the game is best if played with ten or more people.

For details on the book (spoiler alert) see . Here is how the format works: it is a long form show with an intermission. Before the break, a number of stories (6 stories in the original book, but any number above 2 will work) are half told; these stories take place in history, time running forward, and each story is played in a particular, different style. After the break, the stories are finished, one after the other, but in inverse order. By the end of the show, the stories should have connections between them. An example to clarify. Ask 4 suggestions of historical periods & locations, in historical order. The (near & far) future are allowed. Suppose we get: french revolution, first world war Britain, today (2013-ish) USA and 2030 China. This will lead to 4 story lines, and 8 parts, 4 before the break and 4 after. Each story line is played as a Straight Story . For example: Story 1/part 1: Dramatic story in france during revolution Story 2/part 1: Love story during WW1 Story 3/part 1: Thriller in USA, current time Story 4/part 1: Musical in post-communist China Break Second half of story 4 Second part of story 3 Second half of story 2 Second part of story 1 There should be a link from story 1 to story 2, one from story 2 to story 3 and one from story 3 to story 4. All the links should be different in kind and not be purely thematic, e.g. a book written by a character in story 1 may be important in story 2; an invention done in story 2 may be linked to a character's profession in story 3 and so forth. If one link is a character the other links should not be characters. Ideally, not all links are established before the break. For a really concrete example see the wikipedia link on the plots in Mitchell's book. Origin Original book by David Mitchell, 2004. Idea of using the structure for a long form is attributed to Tom Tollenaere."

Turn again and ask for suggestion again and do this once more. Then have players take their original position. The game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the side to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells \"Call\", at which time all players step back to their original positions in the square. MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns accordingly. The 2 players in front start playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again. This is repeated. When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously played scene. They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later, a century later)."

Examples are: An old couple that have been together for ever (they will die) A priest who might lead the survivors (he will die) A wacko scientist who will have a miracle solution to escape the disaster (he will die) A fallen-down hero, a die-hard ex-cop thrown out of the force, a retired fireman, an ex life-guard with a coke habit, you get the picture. He will rise up to the occasion and survive. A kid with loving parents (or a troubled teen not getting along with the parents) (the kid will survive, the parents will die Some sort of troubled, dysfunctional character set up to become the lover of the hero.

If played this way, it`s more a game of wit, and you would probably use it early in a show as an audience (and player) warm-up. Alternatively, you can take your time and play every scene for several minutes, see what develops, and only at the end of each scene tag into another scene. To avoid preconceptions, see Blind Freeze."

At any time, when another player or players enters the stage, the scene is interrupted (or fades out) and the new player(s) start a new scene. This is repeated until all players nhave played. Then the series is restarted with the first scene. This scene continues, or starts at a later point in time (or later in the story, like a Fast Forward ). The scene gets interrupted again, and so forth. The whole is repeated several times. This is typically played without a director - the players decide when to interrupt an ongoing scene.

          :description => "This format is played with 3 experienced players, one MC and another player, dressed up as a Gorilla. The Gorilla is the prize to be won; the best player of the evening gets to spend a week with the Gorilla, and of course this is quite a privilege! The Gorilla enters with last week`s winning player (real or faked). The MC explains that the score for the evening will be counted by means of bananas; the player that end up with most bananas at the end of the game wins another week with the Gorilla. The audience is trained to `vote` by yelling `Banana` (for a good performance) or something else, like `Die` or `Forfeit` for a bad performance. Each scene is then played by 2 players, and directed by the third. The beauty of it all is the fact that not the players are judged by the audience, but the director. Players take turns directing, and after each game the audience either awards the director a banana, or a forfeit. Bananas are pinned on a scoreboard, or pinned onto the winning player`s costume - cardboard bananas are preferable in the latter case. A forfeit is like a punishment for a poorly directed scene. Possible forfeits might be calling your mom and explaining why you`ve been such a lousy director, or having to sing a song about your bad scene. The director gets to choose the scene or the game to be played. Perhaps a list of games to be played this night is on the stage, and directors can write their names next to the games they want to direct. The director directs the scene, gives players side-coachings, can interrupt the scene, introduce tilts or make the players repeat (part of) the scene. To ensure that bad scenes don`t drag on forever, or to prevent directors to play tons of 30-second scenes in order to improve their chances, certain troupes limit the amount of time for directing to like 20 minutes per player. This format can be played with or without attributes and props. The Gorilla might even be used as a prop, or even as a player, although the Gorilla should not try and steal the show. The Gorilla is a player, so he too should be prepared to take risks, and he`s supposed to be naughty. This is a fairly advanced format, as the players not only need to play well, they also need enough insight to effectively direct scenes. This is also a rather nice format, as players are not rewarded; 2 players playing well together generate a banana for the director, and this way the format prevents competition between the players.

It basically consists of 3 components: Scenes, with 2 to 4 players Games Monologues The format starts with a suggestion from the audience - this could really be anything. Players will start associating around the suggestion, and then an opening game is played. In this game, a lot of associated elements round the audience suggestion are presented. The opening game might be a song, a monologue, or simply a group association based on the audience suggestion. The idea is to use the elements and themes that come up or about in the opening game in what follows. Then follow 3 rounds of scenes, all based on the themes found in the opening game. Each round exists out of 3 scenes, all unrelated, but each loosely based on the themes and associations form the opening game. Since these themes originated for the same audience suggestion, the audience will (hopefully) feel some links between the scenes. After the first round of 3 scenes, an improv game is played; this game is unrelated to the 3 scenes played before. Then, in the second round, each of the 3 previous scenes is continued, and more or less obvious links between the scenes start to emerge. This is again followed by an improv game, and then the 3 scenes are played into a conclusion. It`s quite possible that in the third round not every scene is continued; scenes may disappear or even merge with one another. A Harold can be played with a decent number of players (up to 12 or so), players can act in multiple scenes, as the same or as different characters. A Harold can be played with or without props, with or without directors. Whether one sticks to the 3 rounds or not is really not relevant; anything and any combination of games and loose scenes that finally more or less come together can be considered a Harold. Origin This is an American format, described in Del Close `s book Truth in Comedy . We`re not sure whether it`s copyrighted - if you know please let us know."

Player 2 continues with his own line. \"Sure Honey\" 1: \"He said, while turning to the sports page of the paper\". Now, it`s quite clear that player 2 should be paying more attention to the paper than to his wife. Player 1 continues with her own line. \"You`re not listening to me\" and so on. Players refer to each other as `he` and `she`, and endow each other with the next action to take. This can be quite funny, if you endow your partner to do crazy or not-so-nice things to you (or to themselves, but that`s would not be Mr. Nice Guy )."

The quality of the scene is irrelevant here, really; just get into the shop, order what you need, pay for it and off you go. Give us an object (a carrot) and we got a scene in a carrot shop. One player is designated as shopkeeper, and the other will play the customer. The idea is to give the `customer` a basis to build a character. She will enter the shop in that character, and the other player (the shopkeeper) tries to imitate the character as closely as possible. Use the following tricks as stepping stones for building characters: Ask `customer` to talk to you in different voices. Pick one of these and there she goes. Ask the `customer` to pull different kinds of faces. Pick one and there she goes. Pick a body part (elbow). There she goes; taking the suggestion `elbow` as inspiration for her character. Pick an emotion and there she goes. Ask her to move around a bit, dance and let her freeze. The position in which she is frozen is her inspiration for the customer character. This is an exercise for both players, but what is exercised is different for both: for the customer, the exercise is building a character out of a silly suggestion. Note that there are not good or bad characters; anything in the position/suggestion given to the player can be used as inspiration, even if the `link` between the suggestion and the actual character is not obvious. The only goal is to come up with interesting, strong characters. for the shopkeeper this is a listening/watching exercise. The idea is not for the shopkeeper to build a character based on the suggestion; it is for him to imitate as closely the character treats of the customer."

There seem to be leagues in just about every French speaking country; there`s even a league playing this format in the Congo! These leagues meet every year to play a world championship. The format is modeled after an ice hockey match: 2 teams of 6 players, 3 men and 3 women, perhaps with one coach per team play each other during 3 30-minute rounds, in a `ring` resembling an ice hockey field. The game is lead by a referee and 2 aides. The referee draws challenges out of a bin; challenges can be mixed or separated. A mixed improv scene is played by players of both teams; a separated scene is played twice, each time by players from one team. Challenges consist of: Title for the scene: can be anything Number of players per team: can be unlimited, or specified. In some countries they may even specify the genders, like `2 females for the red team, unlimited for the blue team` Category: might be anything, but examples would be Science Fiction, Drama, Dostojewski, Western, Musical, Opera, Without words or Without sound, or To Be Continued. For the latter one, the scene played by the first team is to be continued by the second team Duration: a number of minutes, ranging from 20 minutes to 30 seconds During the improvisation the referee walks though the scenes, and blows `faults` on a whistle. Possible faults would be: Dragging (slow play), Invalid number of players, Violation of the theme (or title), Confusion, Obstruction or Foul Play, Blocking, etc. Every fault is indicated by a particular gesture. When entering the theatre, the audience receives a `fault card` explaining which gesture indicates which fault. Fault can be awarded to an entire team, or to individual players. When a team collects 3 faults, the other team receives an extra point. r When a player collects 3 personal faults, he or she is expelled from the game for 5 or 10 minutes. Every member of the audience also receives a slipper. This can be thrown into the ring when the audience doesn`t like a scene, or even better, at the referee, whenever he or she makes an unpopular decision. After each round the team captains may ask the referee for an explanation on the faults that were blown, and then the audience gets to vote. Every team has a color, and the audience gets colored cards to vote with. After 3 30-minute rounds we know which team won the match. Finally, a celebrity or local hero gets to award `stars` to the 3 best players. This is a very rigid format, in which just about anything, except the scenes themselves, are fixed. There is a whole protocol to be followed to play a match, and even the number of separated and mixed scenes is set in stone. The idea is that the rigidity of the format contrast well with the anything-is-possible con"

The form ends when the circle closes and the last and first characters do a scene. Obviously, there is no need for all characters to bed each other! Switching scenes is done by tagging out (like in Freeze Tag ). The idea is to see different aspects of a character, in different situations, interacting with different characters.

Have all players sit down comfortably, if they want to close their eyes they can do so. Then ask them to blank their mind, to try and think about nothing at all. Let them do this for 2 minutes or so. While they do so, make sure to walk around, to make some minor noise (blow your nose, clear your throat, walk around) - but don`t overdo this. If you can hear cars drive by in the street, or other people in the building, or hear birds sing then you don`t even have to make a noise. Then ask the players who managed to think about absolutely nothing at all. Ask those who say they did whether they heard the birds, the cards, you clearing your throat. If they did, weren`t they thinking about that, then? Now ask the players to close their eyes, and to keep repeating the sound `mihad` in their heads. Have them do this for about 3 minutes. Then ask them again who thought about nothing but `mihad`. If they are honest they should all admit they thought of all kinds of stuff. The point is that our minds just never stop working. Even if you`re trying to concentrate on a repeating sound in your head - a Mantra - your mind will still wander. We are all capable of thinking about several things at a time, some people can keep up to 7 lines of thought going in their minds. Who has never driven a car, being perfectly concentrated on the traffic, without thinking about work, the groceries, the kids ? You can use this exercise to show students they never need to be afraid of a brain freeze - our brains manage to come up with so many things all the time - if you let them. Mantras are used as a technique for (Transcendental and other) meditation. The idea is to keep the most active part of your consciousness busy, and at the same time let unconscious processes and lines of thought surface. This is similar to what happens in our dreams, but it has been proven (we`ve been told) that these meditation techniques can be more relaxing or cleansing than sleep. Don`t take our word for that, though.",

The names of all players are on a big score board. The directors choose for every game the appropriate number of players, perhaps by fishing name tags out of a hat. The directors explain the improv game to be played, perhaps ask the audience for suggestions, direct and correct the scene. After each scene or game the audience decides, by cheering or applause how many points the scene should be awarded. Each player gets as many points as the scene he or she played in was awarded. Once everyone has played in a scene, the players with the lowest score drop off, and the whole thing starts again. The directors ensure that (certainly with large groups of players) that there are more group-games at the start of the evening, and more 2-person scenes or even monologues toward the end of the evening. This is a fun format that can be played with mixed bunches of experienced and not-so- experienced players. Since players are immediately judged, it is perfectly possible to pitch a start player after the first round. Since this system is basically somewhat unfair, and everybody knows this, no one should take elimination too personal (well, that`s the idea anyway). For beginners it`s a nice format, as the directors will correct obvious blunders. And since all players in a scene get the same score, this format limits competition between players in a scene.

Each character should make themselves suspect, at the same time of course denying every involvement in the murder. The characters may try and implicate other characters. Events discovered during the interviews may be played as flashbacks.\n\n            After every character has been interviewed, the detective calls all characters together, Hercule Poirot style, and discusses the motives for each character. The last character discussed is tagged as the killer.\n\n            Then lights go out, and the opening scene is re-played, lights go out, come up again, and we finally see the murder happening, by the designated killer, in slow motion.\n          ",

The challenge is to not be totally predictable with the follow up character choices (avoid immediately choosing to be the spouse when you could be that person`s mailman...or manicurist instead). At the same time you still want to support the story line and justify what the previous characters have already established. The characters don`t have to know each other, but they must have connections (if only through the object). This exercise helps: listening (you must listen to the characters before you to know how you can fit into the story/situation and justify it.) character work Truthfulness (try not to focus `just` on the object.

The idea behind this exercise is that we want our players to be Mr. Nice Guy - players should try to make their co-players happy. The problem is to learn what suggestions are `good`, which suggestions make our other players happy. And that`s what we`re trying to learn with this exercise. Attitude is important for this one: players should not feel inhibited to step out (i.e. they should not feel that they are not accepting players should not feel rejected when others step out. Be happy about that - you are learning which suggestions make others happy! (see Chivalry )."
