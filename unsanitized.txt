All players in a circle, holding all 10 fingers up in the air.  One person at a time, start asking personal questions that take yes-no answers; whoever cannot answer yes to a question, drops a finger.

The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible.  We want to understand the  Platform, the  Characters , the  Environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters.\r\n\r\n Once 3 lines of dialog have been uttered, restart a different scene.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" 3 Series ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t 3 Series \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nEveryone in a circle.  Pick a category (e.g. make of cars, girls names, \r\nkinds of food, kinds of plants, whatever).  First person states an example of the category, and points to someone else.  Keep pointing.  That someone else does the same, with a different item in the category, and so forth, until everyone \r\npoints at one person.\r\n\r\n Then repeat the pattern.  Make eye contact when passing your item to the\r\nnext person.  Drop the pointing arms when everyone is comfortable and the series\r\nis collectively memorized.\r\n\r\n Then do the same with a second category, and make sure the pointing pattern\r\nis different.  Repeat till everyone is comfortable.\r\n\r\n Then do the same exercise, without pointing, and running the 2 categories \r\nat the same time.  Add a third, fourth category if you wish.  No pointing arms any more!\r\n\r\n The idea is not only to listen for the item right before yours in the series (so you know when it`s \nyour turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you.  If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.

This is\nnot really supposed to happen, but it will.

First person says his name, making a gesture (an action) for every syllable.  Mary has 2 syllables, so she does something like \"Ma-\" (wave right hand) \"-ry\" (claps in hands).  Everyone repeats this.  Then the second person calls his name, again with a gesture per syllable.  Group repeats, and then repeats all previous names and syllables.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Simple Continuation ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Simple Continuation \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nA scene is started, played by 2 to 4 players.

As soon as the trainer claps his hands, the player needs to make whatever he was doing more interesting, without\nadvancing.  If our player was opening a briefcase at the clap, he needs to make `opening a briefcase` more interesting; he is not allowed to \ntake something out of the briefcase, as that would be advancing; player needs to stick to `opening the briefcase`.\n\n Notes \n\nSimple to explain but not so easy to play. When done well you move into the clownesque.  Think about Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy or Mr. Bean.\n\n Variations \n\nAt a second clap, allow the player to advance the scene.  Also known as Advancing and Expanding.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Aerobics ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Aerobics \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is a fun observation game.\n\n\n\nPlace all players in a line.  The first player starts walking around the room,\nwalking a large circle.  The second player starts following the first one, \nand tries to move like the first player.   After a few rounds, the first player\ngoes to the back of the line, and the third player starts following and \nimitating the second one.\n\n Notes \n\nTell players to be themselves; don`t try and walk around funny (it`s not\nthe Ministry of Silly Walks after all).\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Three Rules ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Three Rules \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nGet 3 rules from the audience, e.g. players have only one arm, players can`t use a word that contains an `s` and after every question uttered\nplayers needs to yell `Yess!`.

The \nidea is that the rest of the group will lead the blindfolded player through\nthe room, by talking.  \n\n\n\nnAlso known as Airplane. A helpful reader offered us an explanation for the name \n`Airplane`: The blindfoldee (or just eyes\nclosed) is led through a maze composed of furniture and the other actors.\nHe is an \"Airplane\" lost in the fog being talked down by the \"Air Traffic\nController\", who must remain in his/her \"Tower\". Standing on a\nchair/rehearsal block lends visibility for the controller. The airplane\nalso only has a limited amount of fuel left (1-3 minutes, whatever) to\nreach a safe landing (arriving at the Tower). The airplane is also allowed\ntwo \"brushes\"-limited contact with an obstacle. The third brush or a\ndirect hit or stepping on something directly causes a \"crash\". They may\nstep around, over or under the obstacles. Also, the airplane can only fly\nforward. It can turn in any direction, however. The directions must be\ngiven from the pilot`s point of view; a good exercise for fledgling\ndirectors. You can also destroy all the trust you`ve built up in your\nclass by completely clearing \nthe deck and torturing the Pilot. Believe us,\nsomeone will suggest it.\n\n\nAlso known as Obstacle Course.

Everyone in a circle.  We are going to establish a rhythm,\nby saying, all together `Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves`.  Keep repeating this.\n\n\n\nOne person starts making a gesture to this \nrhythm, say, tapping your head with \nyou left hand.  When the sentence is repeated, the player next to her takes over\nthis gesture, while the first one starts a completely different new gesture.  Third time\nthe sentence is done, player three does the first gesture, player two does the \nsecond gesture and player one invents a new one again.  And so on.\n\n This is also a concentration game, though it`s not really difficult.  All \none has to do is watch the previous player, and next time, take over her gesture.\nWhen you`re watching what everyone else is doing you`re going to get lost though.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Alien Tiger Cow ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Alien Tiger Cow \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nFun game to warm up and to teach players some  Chivalry .  \r\n\r\nEveryone in a circle.  There are 3 things a player can be:\r\n An alien: hold you index fingers up next to your head, as little antenna`s and say \r\n`Bleeb bleeb`, bending inwards into the circle;\r\n A cow: bend forward, hold your right \nhand on your tummy and go `Moooo`\r\n A tiger: push your right hand forward, imitating a claw and roar.\r\n On your sign, every player decides to become one of the three.  The idea is \r\nfor everyone to become the same, which obviously won`t be the case, the first time.  We re-do this until everyone is in sync.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\n\r\nInvent your own animals (or things) and let players become juke boxes, birds,\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay `majority wins`:  animals/things that are most in the minority drop out.\r\n\r\nAlso known as Rock Paper Scissors.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Excluding ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Excluding \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n4 players play a scene, in which one of the players gets excluded.  \n\n Notes \n\nThis is a group exercise, in the sense that players should be sensing where the majority of the group is going (see  Alien Tiger Cow ).\n\nTell players not to be afraid of `being nasty` - be extreme in your exclusion (that makes it easier, also for the\nplayer that is excluded - see  Mr. Nice Guy ).  Whoever gets excluded should \ngladly accept this and react accordingly.\n\nExcluded players can go to extremes to be re-included - hilariously funny if even this is thoroughly ignored by the others.\n\n Variations \n\nLet the exclusion evolve; allow a player that got excluded to get 2 others to join him and exclude the fourth one.  \nThis only works if the excluded player first allows herself to be excluded (a little  Chivalry here).\n\n Also known as Alliances. . This game was originally created as a pattern game for \nlong form shows at the Theatresports London Impro Lab in the late 1980`s.  \nThe whole point of the game is NOT to actively try and exclude anyone.  \nThe exclusion of one player should happen as a result of the other players \nmaking alliances with one another.  If you don`t do this the scene doesn`t form\n very good patterns and the players get too competitive.   \nYou also miss the slow, sliding status drops and the desperate attempts to \nhook into an existing alliance, that happen when a player is starting to \nnrealize that they are being excluded.\n\nA good way to start this game would be:\n Start in a black-out seated round a table\n\n While the lights are still down the entire ensemble starts to laugh (as if someone has just told the punchline to a hilarious joke)\n\n The lights slowly fade up as the cast`s laughter winds down and the alliances begin to form\n\n By the end of the scene, which climaxes in a final, dramatic exclusion, we \nusually end up with four to six threads and a clear protagonist \n Big thanks to  Alan Marriott\nof\nCrunchy Frog Collective and Grand Theft Impro\n(London, England) for the additional info on Alliances.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Alliteration Introduction ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Alliteration Introduction \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nExcellent game for players to get to know each other`s names.\n\n\n\nEveryone in a circle.  A player starts the game by introducing himself by making a gesture, and \nalliterating to his name, e.g. \"I`m Wonderful Wendy\" or \"I`m Smart Steve\".  The next player point to the first, repeats\nthe previous player`s name, attribute and \ngesture, and does something similar about himself.\n\n\nAnd so on.

At that point, the\r\nplayer steps out of the scene, and tells the audience what his character is really thinking, \r\nafter which the scene continues.  The other characters of course are not supposed to know what\r\nplayers are thinking, but the players do, and should use this.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nPlayers can use this to reveal their hidden motives.  Other players can play into this, or purposely ignore this knowledge.   \r\n\r\n Gimmick: characters may actually have other things on their minds than what`s going on in the\r\nscene.

Here are some\r\nsuggestions:\r\n Do a Mexican wave (audience making fluent waves with their hands above their head).\r\n Have he pianist/keyboard man make all kinds of sounds and have the audience imitate them\r\n Ask the audience to stand up and do some physical warm-up. Have them shake their arms and legs.\r\n Have the audience introduce themselves to strangers, tell a secret their spouse/partner doesn`t know about to a stranger, have them hug a stranger, tell your neighbor waht you ate today, your pin code\r\n Do an interview with the audience, where the MC is one character (say, a headmaster) and all of the audience \nanother (say a naughty child). The audience needs to reply to the interview in one voice (all saying the same at the same time\r\n - see  One Mouth \r\n). Not an easy one, and if the audience does not feel like doing this it really sucks. When it works it`s a real thrill.\r\n divide the audience in 3 or 4 groups, and give each group a sound. Rehearse the sound with each group. Then tell a silly story, and use these sounds as sound effects. (We saw a pretty gruesome one in which one group was a car (roar), another a dog (bark) and the third group got a kind of splashing sound. The poor dog got run over by the car... not exactly nice but the audience had fun with it)\r\n Do a cheering competition between the men and the women.\r\n Rehearse different kinds of applause (from the `polite` applause when a \r\nscene sucks, over an `ooh` applause for a touching scene, to a wild roar \r\nfor a hilarious scene). Have them rehearse voting for a team by cheering \r\nthe team name (if that`s your format). \nRehearse a `Die` ( see  Die ) if i\r\nyou`re going to be playing scenes in which the audience can decide to throw \r\na player out of the game.\r\n Give the men and the women a different sound and play with that.  Tell them\r\nthey are members of a wild tribe, the women go `Ugh` when you raise your left\r\nhand and the man go `Hagawaga` when you raise your right hand.\r\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Automatic Storytelling ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Automatic Storytelling \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \nThis is an exercise you can only do once with a group.  Use the exercise to\nshow that making stories is not all that difficult.\n\nSplit the group in 2.  Half of the players leave the room while you explain\nthe game to the others: we are going to make stories in pairs.  We will tell\nthe other players that we came up with a great story, and they have to guess\nit.  The catch is that they can only ask yes/no questions, and we do not really\nhave a story.  We will answer `no` to every question that starts with a vowel\nor with a \nconjugation of `to be` (or some other criterion).  In addition, after\nhaving answered 2 consecutive No`s we will always answer a yes.\n\nLet the other players back in and pair them up with the others.

Then 2 players do the interview backwards.\r\nThat means that the first sentence uttered is the last one in the interview, perhaps something like: Thanks for that enlightening explanation. (to the guest)\r\nTo all of you viewers at \nhome, thank you for watching, and see you next week.\r\nAnd then players work their way backwards.\r\n\r\nVarious gimmicks can be played.  For example, in your responses, you can pimp \r\nplayers.  Examples would be: \"Thank you \r\nfor that very energetic answer to the question\", pimping the other player to do something very energetic.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nThe `backwards` gimmick can be used to play any improvized scene - Also known as Backwards Scene. .

Hence they are not looking at each other.  While dancing they perform a 2-3 minute scene.\r\n\r\n This gives for \ngreat listening practice, since players aren`t looking at their partners.

Number 7 then passes in 2 beats to, say number 2, \nsaying `7 to 2`.  It then continues  until someone makes a mistake: if and when that\nhappens everyone says (in 2 beats) `Oh Shit`, after which we repeat Big Booty\n Big Booty Big Booty (\n+ rest on 4th beat), twice.

If any of the 3 players screws up or does not react \r\nhe or she becomes it.\r\n Say `mixer`: the player in the middle becomes a mixer, holding arms \r\nup in the air, sort of horizontally, while her neighbors position themselves\r\nunder her hands, and turn around their axises\r\n Say `toaster` : the player in the middle becomes a slice of bread, and\r\nher neighbors become the toaster, by `building` the toaster with their arms\r\naround the bread.

Then,\r\nwe slowly work up to the use of the dreaded red button, which will make\r\nplayer 2 do something not-so-obvious.  This can be anything, but it should \r\nnot be preconceived.

The first person then presents a problem, preferably through miming or in a single sentence. A third player then enters the scene to fix the problem through miming or in a single sentence. As soon as the problem is fixed, all three players shout 'TADAAA!' accompanied by an appropriate gesture (show hands).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a good exercise to remind players to establish relationships early on, create problems which are relevant to the given setting and to resolve them without delays.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Boris ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Boris \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n2 players play an improvized interrogation scene.

The interrogator randomly throws unconnected elements to the\r\nsuspect, who needs to incorporate these and get himself into (even more) \r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n And then we have Boris, who is a nasty, huge, but invisible thug assisting the interrogator.\r\nEvery time the interrogator does not like the suspect`s answers (and also when\r\nthe suspect does not incriminate himself enough), the interrogator calls on \r\nBoris to torture the suspect, prodding \nhim to confess or incriminate him\r\neven further.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\n we do not establish the crime beforehand\r\n the suspect mimes being tortured by Boris\r\n the investigator can tell Boris what to do (break his leg), but it is more\r\nfun to leave the choice of torture up to the suspect\r\n if the torture does not go far enough to the investigator`s taste, he can \r\nalways call in Boris` evil twin brother, Igor (also invisible)\r\n as a gag, the suspect can also incriminate Boris (who can turn out to be \r\na witness/accomplice to the crime).\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nThis improv game is attributed to  Keith Johnstone .\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Bucket ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Bucket \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nBefore the show ask the audience to write simple sentences on slips of paper.  \r\n\r\nThose go in a big bucket.\r\n\r\n\r\n A scene is improvized, and at random moments the players don`t just invent a \r\nline of dialog, but use a line off \r\na piece of paper \ndrawn from the bucket.\r\nAnything said is accepted, heightened and integrated.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Dry Cleaning Bag of Death ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Dry Cleaning Bag of Death \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nWe need three or four players for this improv game.

All players in a circle.

One player becomes the body of a bunny - this is \r\ndone by holding both arms in front of your chest, elbows touching your rib\r\ncage, and letting hands hang.  Her 2 neighbors become the `ears` of the bunny, \r\nby waving a hand next to the middle player`s ears.  All 3 say `bunny bunny \r\nbunny` together, until the middle player `throws` a `bunny` to another player\r\nin the circle.  This player becomes the bunny body, and his neighbors get\r\nto do the ears.\r\n\r\n Play this game at a high speed.  Mumbling `bunny bunny` en masse gives \r\na nice energy boost.\r\n\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nPlay in slow motion.  Hilarious!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can really invent any object or create or replace the bunny, as long as \r\nyou invent a sound along with it.  Try\nr\n a car, with 2 wheels and a set of wind screen wipers, going `vroom vroom`\r\n a cow, with an udder and 2 horns, going `moo moo`\r\n a washing machine, with 2 players building a `box` with both arms, and the middle player waving her arms in a circle in front of her.

Ask an audience member to pick 4 cards out of a deck, and attach a card to each \r\nplayer`s forehead, so that players can see each other`s card, but not their own.    Use a rubber band or a piece of string for that.\r\n\r\n The idea is to improvize a scene, in which the status order of the characters is defined by the\r\ncards.  Evidently, players don`t know their own status, so the other players \nwill have to endow \r\nthem.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nSet up a location where status is important.  Examples would be a Royal Palace or a highly organized\r\nbureaucracy (the White House ?).\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\n players can only see their own card, but not the others`\r\n give players multiple cards, and let them switch cards in the middle of the \r\nscene.  Statuses (statii ??) should change accordingly.\r\n as an exercise, let players play a scene and then ask them to line up\r\nin status order to see if they `got` their status right.\r\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Cards ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Cards \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAsk the audience to write short sentences on cards.

Setting is a CD shop, one player is the sales person, the other is a client.  Audience suggestion is someone to buy a present for, or an occasion to buy a present.  Say \"graduating medical school\".  The buyer is looking for an appropriate CD to buy for this person/occasion.\r\n\r\n The seller presents several CDs, each CD gets an explicit style/artist, and the seller offers to demo an appropriate song. E.g. for the graduation, \"How about a Lady Gaga album?  Her new album  is called \"Doctor Love\" and it has this great song \"Measles\".  One or more other players (and preferably a musician) then perform the song.\r\n\r\n After 3-4 songs the buyer agrees to buy the album and scene ends.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" LCD ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t LCD \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis improv game is called Location, Career, Death (LCD).\r\n\r\n One player on stage, the others off stage.  The audience provides a location, \r\nan occupation and an object, only known to the player on stage.  Second player enters and a scene is played in gibberish.  Player one needs to communicate the location \r\nto player 2; as soon as player 2 thinks he`s got it, her claps his hands and spins \r\naround.  Then player 2 needs to guess the occupation; clap and spin when you think\r\nyou got it.  Finally, the object needs to be revealed.  As soon as player 2 has the\r\nobject, he needs to kill player 1 with it.\r\n\r\n Then the next player comes on stage and the game recommences, until all players\r\nhave played.  Afterwards, line up the players and ask them where they think they\r\nwere, what their occupation was and what the murder weapon was - usually quite far\r\noff the original suggestion, much \nto the audience`s amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso known as LOW. (Location, Occupation, Weapon).  Also known as Chain Murder. \r\nSee also  Hijacker for a similar game without the  Gibberish component.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nUse a bell, every 10 seconds or so; at the bell players need to clap and spin\r\nand proceed to the next step, even if they are not sure about the where, who and \r\nwhat.  Kind of LCD on speed.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Character Swap ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Character Swap \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n\r\n2 players improvise a scene, and make distinct strong physical and vocal choices.  Scene is played until we know the characters.  Then the roles are reversed, and every player plays the other's character, in the same scene, same location.\r\n The exercise trains listening and physical observation, and is a great way to get players to break away from their stock characters.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Character Walk ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Character Walk \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nGreat exercise to develop characters. Players mill about the room as themselves. Ask the players to find some sort of inspiration, and then they should use that to change their walk. Anything can be used as inspiration: use an emotion (happy!), an occupation (farmer!), a stereotype (Irish!), an animal (Snake!) or even an object (grandfather clock!). \r\n\r\n Next, turn the way you are walking into a character.  Explore how the character walks and - by  Association - figure out as much as possible about this character.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nIf you use a way of movement as inspiration you end up with something like  Fast Food Laban .\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Chivalrous Couples ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Chivalrous Couples \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nOne person with a loud voice will stand on a chair or other high place so that they can be seen above the heads of the group. After you have explained the game and everyone is ready the person on the chair will call out one of the following couples: Knight and Queen, Prince and Princess, and Horse and Rider. When one of these three couples is called people must get into pairs. If Horse and Rider were called one of the people in the pairs will be the Horse and one will be the Rider. Then the pairs will get into the correct formation.\r\n\r\nEach of the three chivalrous couples has its own formation that goes with it. The Knight and Queen's formation is one person as the \"Knight\" down on one knee and the other person as the \"Queen\" sitting on the \"Knight's\" knee. The Prince and Princess formation is one person as the \"Prince\" will have the the other person, the \"Princess,\" in their arms. \nThe Horse and Rider formation is the \"Horse\" will be standing up and the \"Rider\" will be riding piggy-back on the \"Horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe last pair to get into the correct formation is either out of the game or they \"Take 5\" off to the side of the group. After one chivalrous couple has been called and one or two pairs of people have been eliminated have the group mingle. Then randomly call another couple.

Once the rhythm is established, you can leave out the snaps - that`ll make things more \r\nunderstandable.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use this for both  Last Letter games or  Free Association Circle .\r\n Try this with two circles. Have one circle associate freely, and another\r\ncircle on  Last Letter .  Whenever a player misses a beat she should switch\r\ncircles.\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nIf you do this with 2 circles, you will probably find that the rhythms for both\r\ncircles synchronize.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Clap Snap Stamp ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Clap Snap Stamp \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAll players in pairs, facing each other.

So the person who \nbegins (the one that knows whatâ\u0080\u0099s going on) will declare whoever talks first \ndead by saying \"youâ\u0080\u0099re dead\".  That person isnâ\u0080\u0099t \"out\" or anything, itâ\u0080\u0099s \njust for effect.  The game continues until the players catch on.  If somebody \nthinks they get it, the leader gives them a chance to say the clicks and \nbangs and they get to announce who is dead; the leader will then be able to \ntell if they understand the secret if they \nannounce the right person as \nbeing dead.\n\nMake sure that once the players begin to catch on, they donâ\u0080\u0099t spoil it for \nthe others by letting the cat out of the bag.  Also, the game is best if \nplayed with ten or more people.\n\n Contributed by Jeannie Smith from Hawai.

The same structure can be used to create a Long Form improv show.  For details on the book (spoiler alert) see .\r\n\r\n Here is how the format works: it is a long form show with an intermission.  Before the break, a number of stories (6 stories in the original book, but any number above 2 will work) are half told; these stories take place in history, time running forward, and each story is played in a particular, different style.  After the break, the stories are finished, one after the other, but in inverse order.  By the end of the show, the stories should have connections between them.\r\n\r\n  An example to clarify.  Ask 4 suggestions of historical periods & locations, in historical order.  The (near & far) future are allowed.  Suppose we get: french revolution, first world war Britain, today (2013-ish) USA and 2030 China.  This will lead to 4 story lines, and 8 parts, 4 before the break and 4 after.  Each story line is played as a  Straight Story .  For example:\r\n Story 1/part 1: Dramatic story in france during revolution\r\n Story 2/part 1: Love story during WW1\r\n Story 3/part 1: Thriller in USA, current time\r\n Story 4/part 1: Musical in post-communist China\r\n Break\r\n Second half of story 4\r\n Second part of story 3\r\n Second half of story 2\r\n Second part of story 1\r\n There should be a link from story 1 to story 2, one from story 2 to story 3 and one from story 3 to story 4.  All the links should be different in kind and not be purely thematic, e.g. a book written by a character in story 1 may be important in story 2; an invention done in story 2 may be linked to a character's profession in story 3 and so forth.   If one link is a character the other links should not be characters.  Ideally, not all links are established before the break.  For a really concrete example see the wikipedia link on the plots in Mitchell's book.\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nOriginal book by David Mitchell, 2004.

Feel free to replace all the players instead of just\nthe player who said the last line.\n\n Rather than just stepping in and repeating a line, you might want to\ncall `FLIP` (or freeze).

When the retriever bumps into someone that does not move (a dead body)\nshe can revive the dead by rubbing them with the towel.\n\n When the retriever gets killed, she screams and stops moving.   When another\nliving person bumps into the retriever (recognized by the scarf), the retriever\nis revived, and the one that revived the retriever becomes the new retriever.\n\n Play till everyone is dead or bored.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Death in a Minute ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Death in a Minute \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n2 or 3 players play a 1 minute scene, in which one player must die.\n\n Notes \n\nTell players to take risks.

The \ngame is played in 3 rounds.  In every round, each player offers some information about how\nthey happened to die.  At the end of the thirds round, they should all be dead.\n\n Notes \n\nIt`s fun to take risks - if in the first round each of the players just offers what they happened \nto be doing the day they died, and where.  It is quite a challenge to get these 4 stories together,\nincluding the deaths of all characters, by the end of the third round. \nAlso known as Death Con. .\n\n\nSee also  Goon River for a more open, more free  Long Form version \nof the same  Handle .\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Deconstruction ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Deconstruction \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is a  Long Form format.  It starts with one rather long scene, \nwhich is followed by other, probably shorter, scenes that somehow connect to\nthe first scene.  Possible connections are:\n Characters return\n Characters of situations mentioned in the first scene appear in the \nsubsequent scenes\n Subsequent scenes take place in the same environment as the first scene\n The reason why the first scene should be fairly long is that it should\nprovide enough information for other scenes to build on.  The name \n`Deconstruction` can be interpreted as \"Take a first scene, and then \ndeconstruct it by using characters, locations, situations, played or referred\nto, and play/re-use those in further scenes\".\n\n Origin \n\nDeconstruction originated at ImprovOlympic in Chicago.\n\n For a long discussion about the format and its origin see \n Chicago Improv .\n\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Diamond ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Diamond \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n4 players in a square; 2 in front, 2 behind them.  The MC or host asks for an audience suggestion for the 2 players in\r\nfront.  Then the host asks the players to turn the square (to the right or to the left).  So now we have a \r\ndifferent combination of players in front.  These 2 get an audience suggestion.  Turn again and ask for suggestion\r\nagain and do this once more.  Then have players take their original position.\r\n\r\n  The game is played as follows: the 2 players in front start improvising a scene; the 2 players in the back move to the\r\nside to clear the stage. Players play until the host yells \"Call\", at which time all players step back to their\r\noriginal positions in the square.  MC then calls Right or Left, and square turns \naccordingly.  The 2 players in front\r\nstart playing a scene based on their suggestion until MC calls again.\r\n\r\n This is repeated.  When 2 players are up front for the second or third time, they continue their previously \r\nplayed scene.  They can either plainly continue it, or continue at some time in the future (a day later, a year later,\r\na century later). Also known as Revolver. Also known as Pan Left Pan Right.

Whenever the MC ring a bell (or yells `Ding`), \nthe player that is doing\nsomething/saying something needs to say/do something else.\n\n Notes \n\nDoing `something else` is quite often interpreted as doing/saying the \nopposite of what you did before.  One can be more creative, e.g. repeat\nwhat was said in a different emotion.\n\n\n\nIf you use this as an exercise on  Spontaneity the trainer can `Ding`\nquite often (very frustrating for the players, \nbut they will come up with\nstuff they never would have thought of before).

Try again and player is woken up by the neighbour drilling a hole\nin the wall.  `Ding`.  You got it.

Examples are a tropical tourist paradise, a big building.\r\n\r\n The story starts right before the disaster, usually some character foreseeing the disaster, discovering a bad omen or some foretelling sign.\r\n\r\n Next we see lots of characters in the given location.  These should be the archetypical characters one finds in typical disaster movies.  Examples are:\r\n An old couple that have been together for ever (they will die)\r\n A priest who might lead the survivors (he will die)\r\n A wacko scientist who will have a miracle solution to escape the disaster (he will die)\r\n A fallen-down hero, a die-hard ex-cop thrown out of the force, a retired fireman, an ex life-guard with a coke habit, you get the \npicture.  He will rise up to the occasion and survive.\r\n A kid with loving parents (or a troubled teen not getting along with the parents) (the kid will survive, the parents will die\r\n Some sort of troubled, dysfunctional character set up to become the lover of the hero.\r\n Watch some disaster movies and pick your favorite cliche characters. \r\n Next, disaster strikes.  Light, sound and smoke effects are a must.  Why not use a musician with electric distortion guitar for added color.\r\n\r\n The following scenes show the characters in their quest to survive.  Most will die (spectacularly).  Feel free to provide background on the characters using flashbacks.\r\n\r\n Story ends with the hero + lover + kid (if available and/or still alive) escaping the carnage, ready and set to live happily ever after.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Disc(1) ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Disc(1) \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nTell the players to imagine the stage is a disc, only supported right in the \ncenter of the stage.

The goal is to\nkeep the disc balanced.\n\n  Game starts with a player entering the disc; he is the leader.  As soon\nas the leader stops milling about on the disc, another player must jump in and\nrestore the balance.  The new player becomes the new leader, and the previous\nleader becomes a follower.\n\n As soon as the balance is restored, the leader can start walking around; the other player stays where he is.  As soon as the leader stops again, the follower(s) move and restore the balance.  After that, the leader becomes one of the \nfollowers, and a new leader jumps in.\n\n The group of followers may split into groups of equal size, and restore the\nbalance that way.\n\n Keep in mind that followers don`t start moving until the leader stops.\n\n See also  Disc(1) .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Dissociation ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Dissociation \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n\n Description \n\nThis game can be done individually, or you can have one player do it in front of the class.\nPlayers say as many words that have nothing to do with each other, until they start \nassociating.  Restart as soon as you`ve got an association.\n\n\n\nExample: cat, deodorizer, house, green, grass.  Here we restart, because grass is obviously an\nassociation on green.\n\n Notes \n\nYou can use this game to show that \nassociation is natural, and that it is actually difficult not to associate.

They then each secretly pick a specific distance they want to be from the other person and repeat the interchange while maintaining the distance. The maintaining of distance automatically seems to affect people`s emotional commitment and inflection. The key is \nto have a specific distance in mind down to the inch. If one person picks 1 foot but the other picks a foot and a half. You will see some interesting conflict because of that extra half a foot.\n\n Variations \n\nPlay a scene where the players are connected by a stick, a piece of rope\nor wood.

It can be structured in various ways.\r\n\r\n Here`s one in  5 beats: ask for an object.  Then\r\nn Lead singer sings verse about the object\r\n All sing Chorus, in the style of I love my (object)\r\n Verse 2: explain how you found your object\r\n (all) chorus on how you love your object\r\n Verse 3: That fateful night ... explain how you lost your beloved object.  This can be done as a parlando (i.e. you speak to the music, rather than sing)\r\n (bridge) Explain how bad you miss your object\r\n (all) chorus on how you miss your object\r\n Verse 4: explain how your replaced your object by a new (or other) one\r\n (all) chorus on how you love your new object (finale!)\r\n Feel free to drop e.g. the first of second chorus if you feel it drags you down.

Get a topic, line up the players, and start\r\nimprovising a song around the theme, usually without using a piano player (it\r\nwould get too structured and cluttered if you so).  Use the suggestion to improvise\r\ninstruments (or their sound) with.  Players can offer bits of  Narrative by\r\nsinging over the `music`.  Once the narrative patterns are clean, any player can\r\nstep out of the song and start a scene based on what was established.  \r\n\r\n When the scene is done the `music` resumes till someone else starts a scene.\r\nNice if the scenes start to connect, or if characters from different scenes meet\r\nand interact.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThis is a bit like a  Harold but without the games.

All players in 2 \r\nrows.   2 facing\r\nplayers play the exercise, the others watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayer 1 sets a (part of a) platform by miming a door.  As soon as player 2 has\r\nan idea \nabout where player 1 might be, player 2 steps into the scene and offers\r\na line of dialog, expressing where we are.  Player 2 answers player 1, \r\nacknowledging player 1`s offer.  This ends the scene.\r\n\r\n The audience should know after these 2 lines of dialog where the players\r\nare, and who they are, or what their relationship is to one another.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\n`Doors` can be anything that separates one physical location from another.  \r\nPlayers can mime real doors, but also gates, curtains, you name it.  Encourage \r\nplayers to try out as many types of `doors` as possible.

Players are not allowed to explicitly\n tell the other\nplayer what to do.\n\n\n\nExample: an arena in ancient Rome.  Player 1 needs player 2 to taste the sand in the arena, and player\n2 needs to get player 1 \nto tie a knot in a lion`s tail.\n\n Notes \n\nWorks best is players take risks.

Start with 3 things:\r\n\r\n an Elephant, consisting of a trunk, made by the middle player, by holding your nose with one hand, and extending your other arm through the arm that holds the hand that holds the nose (does this make any sense?).\r\nThe neighboring players each form a big ear, using both arms.  Don`t forget to attach the ears to the\r\nelephant`s head. Make an \nelephant sound.\r\n A palm tree: the middle player is the tree, her neighbors become the waving leaves of the tree.  Make windy noise\r\n A car: the middle player holds the steering wheel, the neighbors do the \r\nwheels.  Make car engine noise.\r\n\r\nOne player in the middle.  Point to a person and yell Elephant (or Palm Tree, or whatever was agreed).  Then choose another player\r\nand yell something else.  Do this at high speed.\r\n\r\n Now for the extension: when someone makes a mistake, look at what the person does, and add that to the list of possibilities.  For\r\nexample, someone might be waving their arms incorrectly in from of them, trying to build the trunk of the elephant.  If the group \r\nthings this resembles, say, a swimmer, we decide on adding a swimmer to the list of options.

This can also be used as a technique during  Performance .\r\n\r\n The idea is to open a 2 player scene with a line of dialog that manipulates the other player's emotional state. This can be positive (Gee Robin, you look handsome today) or negative (Mary, have you been snacking again lately, I think you've gained even more weight).  Player 2 should accept this manipulation, and let it change the emotional state of her character.\r\n\r\n We mentioned  Trust : it should be clear to the players that we are manipulating the emotions of characters, not the players themselves.  Furthermore, the word 'manipulation' may have a negative connotation for some - this is merely a technique, not intended to make others feel bad/sad/manipulated.  Do not use this exercise unless the players have developed a great deal of trust; if this exercise makes a player uncomfortable, then stop the exercise. \r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nThis can be done as a one-person exercise as well: have the player say or do something that will manipulate her own character's emotional state.\r\n\r\n Another variation is to blurt out dialog to which the emotional reaction cannot be predicted (Honey I'm pregnant) - but also in that case player 2 should react with a change in emotion.  E.g. happy: That's so wonderful baby, we've been trying for such a long time. Versus mad: You silly cow, don't tell me you forgot your birth control pills again. Versus sad: That makes me think of poor little Jimmy again, I miss him so much.\r\n\r\n See also  Pimping and  Shivving .\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Emotional Mirror ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Emotional Mirror \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nPlayers in pairs, facing each other.

Subtexts might be:\n you want to seduce the other\n you are a nerd\n you like to make people laugh\n you want to impress others\n you are a nasty person\n you try to be ordinary\n you are an optimist/pessimist\n \nyou will never find a girlfriend/boyfriend\n Notes \n\n If you are using this in a workshop it might be a good idea to ask the\nplayers how one would behave given a certain subtext.  Stress that you are \nlooking for  Truthfulness .\n\n This is an excellent technique to find a character.  You can actually\nuse this for performance - just give yourself a subtext when you jump onto\nthe stage and see what happens.\n\n See also  Status .\n\n Origin \n Described in  Impro for Storytellers : the book contains an appendix\non how to play for different subtexts.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Fast Forward ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Fast Forward \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nFor this handle we need a `director`, or the MC can take on this role.

In this format the audience provides 5 different themes, objects, emotions, locations or situations. Then, the game is played in 5 rounds.\r\n\r\nIn the first round 5 scenes are played, each based on one of the audience suggestions. These scenes are totally unrelated. After the first round the audience decides which of the 5 scenes seen should be discontinued.\r\n\r\nIn the second round, the 4 remaining scenes are continued, and links start to appear between these scenes. Again, after this, the audience decides which scene to dump.\r\n\r\nThis continues until after 4 rounds there are only 2 scenes left. In the fifth round these scenes come together in one final scene. \r\nThis format can be played with or without props and/or director(s).\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nThis can also be played without dropping a scene line.  In that case you`d probably use 3\r\nrather than 5 scenes.\r\n\r\nAlso known as Triptych.\r\nAlso known as Tapestry.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Five Things ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Five Things \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nOne player leaves the stage while the  Host asks for an everyday activity.\r\nThen, audience and host will change 5 things about that activity.  Example: \r\nsuggestion is feeding the cat.  One might change the following:\r\n change the cat into something else, say a tiger\r\n change the verb into some other verb, say deep frying\r\n change the location from where one might feed the cat.  Say the Vatican.\r\n change the character.  Say character changes from cat-owner to postman\r\n add interaction with a famous person, say Elvis.\r\n\r\nAfter that the 1st player is brought back in and a scene is played in  Gibberish .

The second line follows the first player, and mimics her movements, and the third line follows the second line.\n\nThe top player can alternate however she wants (and can be guided with e.g. a \nchange in the music).  \n\n\n\nThe top player can even turn around, and face the second line.  Confusion will\nbe complete.  Other variations can happen when the top player bumps into the \nlast line, and takes over their movements.\n\nSee also  Aerobics\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Follow the Leader ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Follow the Leader \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAll but one in a circle, one player in the middle.

At this point all characters remaining on stage disappear, and the story continues with the character who just left the scene, and a totally different story line is allowed to develop.

There are various ways of playing\nthis (see Variations and see other games in the  Association category.\n\n  The Basics \n\n In a free association we will ask players to say the first thing they\nthink about when hearing (or seeing, feeling, smelling or tasting) anything\nanother player provides.\n \n It should be stressed that anything is valid, as long as it is not\n preconceived: the association should be based on what the previous player\nhas offered.\n\n\n Variations \n\nHere is are list of Free Association games:\nn  Free Association Circle\n  Free Association Lines\n  Walk-over Association\n  Word Ball\n  Firing Squad\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Free Association Circle ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Free Association Circle \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nEveryone in a circle and we establish a rhythm, by swinging a hand.  Once a rhythm is established, one player starts by tossing a word to his neighbor, who\nassociates on the word and tosses another word to his neighbor.\n\n\n\n\nIt`s \nimportant to stay in the rhythm.  Tell the players to just say `banana` if\nthey feel they can`t think of a word, as long as the rhythms does not get broken. \n\nSee also  Word Ball and  Clap Snap Association .\n\n Variations \n\nTry this in combination with  Last Letter .

Place all players on 2 lines,\nfacing each other.  One player starts walking to another player in the other\nline.  Just before he gets to that other player, he throws her a word.  The\nreceiver starts crossing the line towards someone else, and the first player\ntakes her place in the line.  The receiver now becomes the thrower, throwing\nthe first word she can think of to another player, who then starts walking, and so on.\n\n Variations \n\nTry with 2 or more walkers at the same time.   Many players, especially new\nones, tend to find it easier to freely associate when there are multiple \nwalkers: they feel less `on the spot` (as no-one is watching them in all\nthe commotion) and they don`t really have the time \nto get in their heads.\n\n\nCan be combined with  Last Letter .\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Free Falling ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Free Falling \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n\n Description \n\nNice, but a bit dangerous exercise to build trust.  In it`s simplest (and \nsafest) form all players stand in a circle, one player in the middle.  The \nplayer in the middle closes her eyes, slowly turns around, and then lets \nherself fall backwards (or forwards).  The other players need to catch her.\n\n Variations \n\nBe careful with this: have one player stand on a chair or a table\n, the others in front\nof him.  Player closes his eyes and lets himself fall, hopefully he will be\ncaught by the others. \n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Freeze Tag ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Freeze Tag \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n2 actors start an improvized scene.  At any point in time another player can call Freeze.\r\nThis player then tags out one of the 2 actors, and takes his place.  Both\r\nplayers then start a new scene, justifying their positions.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThe way this improv \ngame is played quite often goes a bit against good improv, as many groups hardly\r\ntake the time to develop a story line.  If played this way, it`s more a game of wit, and you\r\nwould probably use it early in a show as an audience (and player) warm-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can take your time and play every scene for several minutes, see what\r\ndevelops, and only at the end of each scene tag into another scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid preconceptions, see  Blind Freeze .

At any time, when \nanother player or players enters the stage, the scene is interrupted (or fades out) and the new player(s) start a new scene.  This is repeated until all players\nnhave played.  \n\n\nThen the series is restarted with the first scene.  This scene continues, or \nstarts at a later point in time (or later in the story, like a  Fast Forward ).

One player is the deceased, bang in the middle and very visible in or on e.g. a table or a couple of chairs representing the casket.  \r\n Audience suggests an odd or peculiar way to die, and then the death is played.  Perhaps characters present during the funeral service were there at the time of death.  After death, the dead gets back into her coffin and we return to \nthe service.\r\n Then, taking turns, guests at the funeral service step up and present, in a monologue, their experience with the deceased.

For your translation, use the first thing that\ncomes to mind.  You may be inspired by the whole sound of the word (it might\nsound like something `known`), or parts of the word (only the vowels, or only\nthe consonants), or by the intonation of the `giver`, or even by her expression\nor body language. \n\n\nTry gibberish in different `languages` or `accents`.\n\nAlso known as Gibberish Dictionary.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Give and Take ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Give and Take \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is a variation on  Walking by Numbers : all players find a position the room.  \n One person must always make sound and one person must walk.

He`s the goalie.  The other players all think of an opening\nline for a scene, and a character.  When everyone has their opening line and character, we bombard the goalie\nwith these offers, one at a time.  Goalie needs to react right away to an offer, acknowledging the opening and\ncharacter, snap into an opposite character and reply \nto the opening.  Immediately after that the next player comes \nup with his or her offer.\n\n\nThis exercise is good for teaching players to react right away, and to snap into a character almost without thinking.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Goon River ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Goon River \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis is a improv format that consists of monologues.  The story is not played, but told.\r\nThe players (typically 3 or 4) line up in front of the audience,  Based on\r\na single audience suggestion they all tell the same story, each as their \r\nown character in that story.\r\n\r\n The play usually starts with every character introducing him or herself.  The \r\norder in which characters speak is not really important, as long as they all speak.\r\n\r\n After the introductions, things start to happen.  Every character reflects on\r\nwhat is happening from their own perspective, and each character adds elements to \r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n Keep going (and make sure that every character keeps contributing) and \nr\n Reincorporating as long as things stay interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso known as Also known as Spoon River. , Also known as Moon River. , Also known as Goon River. and\r\nAlso known as Spork River. .\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also  Voices From Heaven for a short form game version which is \r\nreally based on the same handle.\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nOrigin unknown, but the story goes that the name of the format would be \r\ninspired by a book Spoon River by Edgar Lee Masters (hop on to \r\n\r\nwww.outfitters.com/illinois/fulton/masters.html for more info on \r\nSpoon River).\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThis is a great way of exercising monologues!\r\n\r\n Referring back to the work of Masters, many groups tend to end the format \r\nwith the death of (one or more of) the character(s).\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Gorilla Theatre ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Gorilla Theatre \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n\r\nThis format is played with 3 experienced players, one MC and another \nplayer, \r\ndressed up as a Gorilla. The Gorilla is the prize to be won; the best player \r\nof the evening gets to spend a week with the Gorilla, and of course this is \r\nquite a privilege!\r\n\r\nThe Gorilla enters with last week`s winning player (real or faked). The MC\r\n explains that the score for the evening will be counted by means of bananas; \r\nthe player that end up with most bananas at the end of the game wins another \r\nweek with the Gorilla. \r\n\r\nThe audience is trained to `vote` by yelling `Banana` (for a good performance) \r\nor something else, like `Die` or `Forfeit` for a bad performance. \r\n\r\nEach scene is then played by 2 players, and directed by the third. The \r\nbeauty of it all is the fact that not the players are judged by the audience,\r\n but the director. \r\n\r\nPlayers take turns directing, and after each game the audience either awards\r\n the director a banana, or a forfeit. Bananas are pinned on a scoreboard, \r\nor pinned onto the winning player`s \ncostume - cardboard bananas are preferable\r\n in the latter case. \r\n\r\nA forfeit is like a punishment for a poorly directed scene. Possible forfeits \r\nmight be calling your mom and explaining why you`ve been such a lousy \r\ndirector, or having to sing a song about your bad scene. \r\n\r\nThe director gets to choose the scene or the game to be played. Perhaps a \r\nlist of games to be played this night is on the stage, and directors can \r\nwrite their names next to the games they want to direct. The director\r\n directs the scene, gives players side-coachings, can interrupt the scene, \r\nintroduce tilts or make the players repeat (part of) the scene. To ensure \r\nthat bad scenes don`t drag on forever, or to prevent directors to play \r\ntons of 30-second scenes in order to improve their chances, certain troupes \r\nlimit the amount of time for directing to like 20 minutes per player.\r\n\r\nThis format can be played with or without attributes and props. The Gorilla \r\nmight even be used as \na prop, or even as a player, although the Gorilla \r\nshould not try and steal the show. The Gorilla is a player, so he too \r\nshould be prepared to take risks, and he`s supposed to be naughty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly advanced format, as the players not only need to play well, \r\nthey also need enough insight to effectively direct scenes. This is also a \r\nrather nice format, as players are not rewarded; 2 players playing well \r\ntogether generate a banana for the director, and this way the format \r\nprevents competition between the players.\r\n\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nAttributed to  Keith Johnstone , and described in  Impro for Storytellers .\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Greatest Hits ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Greatest Hits \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis game was made famous by the TV show \"Who'se line is is anyways\".  Typically played with 4 players.  2 of these are the hosts of a tv commercial, trying to sell a CD compilation of 'greatest hits'.  Audience suggestion is the theme of the CD.  E.g. a profession: \"accountants\".  The CD to be sold is then \"Songs for Accountants\".  \r\n\r\n The hosts discuss the CD, why viewers should buy it, and select 3-4 tracks. Each track gets a title and a style, e.g. (for accountants) \"The IRS blue\" - which in this case also implies the style.  The other players then improvise that song, in that style.\r\n\r\n For examples, do a search on youtube for WLIIA Greatest Hits.\r\n\r\n See also  CD Shop .\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Greetings ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Greetings \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAll players start milling about the room.

Any doors placed remain where they are, and\r\nthe characteristics of the door are not to change.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen another player enters the same space, and places a mimed object in that\r\nspace, either by physically placing the object (\ncarrying, wheeling \r\n or pushing it into\r\nthe space, or by just `using` it, for example by hanging her coat over a chair.\r\nSecond players leaves the room, either through one of the established doors,\r\nor by placing a new exit.\r\n\r\n This continues until every player has done their thing.

Players will start associating around the suggestion, and then an \nopening game is played. In this game, a lot of associated elements round \nthe audience suggestion are presented. The opening game might be a song, \na monologue, or simply a group association based on the audience suggestion. \nThe idea is to use the elements and themes that come up or about in the \nopening game in what follows.\n\nThen follow 3 rounds of scenes, all based on the themes found in the opening \ngame. Each round exists out of 3 scenes, all unrelated, but each loosely based \non the themes and associations form the opening game. Since these themes \noriginated for the same audience suggestion, \nthe audience will (hopefully) \nfeel some links between the scenes.\n\nAfter the first round of 3 scenes, an improv game is played; this game \nis unrelated to the 3 scenes played before. Then, in the second round, each \nof the 3 previous scenes is continued, and more or less obvious links between \nthe scenes start to emerge. This is again followed by an improv game, and then \nthe 3 scenes are played into a conclusion.\n\nIt`s quite possible that in the third round not every scene is continued; \nscenes may disappear or even merge with one another.\n\nA Harold can be played with a decent number of players (up to 12 or so), \nplayers can act in multiple scenes, as the same or as different characters. \nA Harold can be played with or without props, with or without directors.\n\n\nWhether one sticks to the 3 rounds or not is really not relevant; anything and \nany combination of games and loose scenes that finally more or less come \ntogether can be considered a Harold.\n\n Origin \n\n\nThis \nis an American format, described in  Del Close `s\nbook  Truth in Comedy . We`re not sure whether it`s copyrighted -\nif you know please let us know.\n\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Hats ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Hats \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \nA very silly game.  2 improvisers put on hats, preferably similarly sized.  Scene ends when one player grabs the other player`s hat or tries to do so and misses.  Any grab, move to grab or defensive movement needs to be \nfustified.  Try and play the scene for reality.   \n\n  Variations \n\nStart with a 20 second window in which no grabs are allowed, so that the \nscene and the relationships between the characters can evolve.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" He Said She Said ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t He Said She Said \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nExcellent game to show how  Endowment works.  2 players; each player will\nstate the action the other player must perform, followed by his own line.\n\n\nExample:\n 1: \"I want a divorce\"\n 2: \"She said, while grabbing a knife from the kitchen table.\" At this \npoint player 1 needs to take a knife.  Player 2 continues with his own line. \n\"Sure Honey\"\n 1: \"He said, while turning to the sports page of the paper\".  Now, it`s \nquite clear that player 2 should be paying more attention to the paper than \nto his wife.  Player 1 continues with her own line. \"You`re not listening to\nme\"\n and so on.\n\nPlayers refer to each other as `he` and `she`, and endow each other with the\nnext action to take.  This can be quite funny, if you endow your partner to\ndo crazy or not-so-nice things to you (or to themselves, but \nthat`s would not \nbe  Mr. Nice Guy ).\n\n Variations \n\nCan be done with 4 players: 2 provide the lines, and the 2 others provide \nthe `directions` - each director provides the action for one of the 2 talkers.\n\n\n\nCan also be one with 3 players: one provides directions and both other players\ndo their own dialogs.\n\n Notes \n\nKeep the action do-able and active.  Making someone else `think about something`\nis hard to play, and not very active.\n\nAlso known as He Said While She.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Heave Ho ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Heave Ho \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is like an extended version of  Tossing to be played with 16+ players.\nAll players but one form 2 lines, facing each other, and link hands to form a \nplatform, which is used to heave the last player from one end of the line to \nthe other.\n\n\nBest to remove shoes, coins, and any other objects that might fall or hurt \nsomeone. \n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Hesitation ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Hesitation \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nIn this game a scene is played, in which at any time, any player may `hesitate`, and ask the audience for help.

One player is designated as shopkeeper, \nand the other will play the customer.\n\n The idea is to give the `customer` a basis to build a character.  She will\nenter the shop in that character, and the other player (the shopkeeper) tries\nto imitate the character as closely as possible.\n\n Use the following tricks as stepping stones for building characters:\n Ask `customer` to talk to you in different voices.  Pick one of these and \nthere she goes.  \n Ask the `customer` to pull different kinds of faces.  Pick one and there \nshe goes.\n Pick a body part (elbow).  There she goes; taking the suggestion `elbow` \nas inspiration \nfor her character.\n Pick an emotion and there she goes.\n Ask her to move around a bit, dance and let her freeze.  The position in \nwhich she is frozen is her inspiration for the customer character.\n This is an exercise for both players, but what is exercised is different for both:\n for the customer, the exercise is building a character out of a silly suggestion.  Note that there are not good or bad characters; anything in the position/suggestion given to the player can be used as inspiration, even if the `link` between the suggestion and the actual character is not obvious.  The only goal is to come up with interesting, strong characters.\n for the shopkeeper this is a listening/watching exercise.  The idea is not for the shopkeeper to build a character based on the suggestion; it is for him\nto imitate as closely the character treats of the customer.\n See also  Opposite Characters .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Impro Match ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Impro Match \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n\r\nThis format does not have a specific name  and is mainly popular in French \r\nspeaking countries. There seem to be leagues in just about every French \r\nspeaking country; there`s even a league playing this format in the Congo! \r\nThese leagues meet every year to play a world championship. \r\n\r\nThe format is modeled after an ice hockey match: 2 teams of 6 players, 3 men and 3 women, perhaps with one coach per team play each other during 3 \r\n30-minute rounds, in a `ring` resembling an ice hockey field. The game is \r\nlead by a referee and 2 aides. \r\n\r\nThe referee draws challenges out of a bin; challenges can be mixed or separated.\r\n A mixed improv scene is played by players of both teams; a separated scene is \r\nplayed twice, each time by players from one team. Challenges consist of:\r\n\r\nTitle for the scene: can be anything \r\n\r\nNumber of players per team: can be unlimited, or specified. In some countries\r\n they may even specify the genders, like \n`2 females for the red team, \r\nunlimited for the blue team` \r\n\r\nCategory: might be anything, but examples would be Science Fiction, Drama, \r\nDostojewski, Western, Musical, Opera, Without words or Without sound, \r\nor To Be Continued. For the latter one, the scene played by the first team \r\nis to be continued by the second team \r\n\r\nDuration: a number of minutes, ranging from 20 minutes to 30 seconds \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the improvisation the referee walks though the scenes, and blows `faults` on a whistle. Possible faults would be: Dragging (slow play), \r\nInvalid number of players, Violation of the theme (or title), Confusion, \r\nObstruction or Foul Play, Blocking, etc. Every fault is indicated by a \r\nparticular gesture. When entering the theatre, the audience receives a \r\n`fault card` explaining which gesture indicates which fault. Fault can be \r\nawarded to an entire team, or to individual players. When a team collects \r\n3 faults, the other team receives an extra point. \nr\nWhen a player collects 3 personal faults, he or she is expelled from the \r\ngame for 5 or 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the audience also receives a slipper. \r\n This can be thrown into the ring when the audience doesn`t like a scene, \r\nor even better, at the referee, whenever he or she makes an unpopular \r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nAfter each round the team captains may ask the referee for an explanation \r\non the faults that were blown, and then the audience gets to vote. Every \r\nteam has a color, and the audience gets colored cards to vote with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 3 30-minute rounds we know which team won the match. Finally, a \r\ncelebrity or local hero gets to award `stars` to the 3 best players.\r\n\r\nThis is a very rigid format, in which just about anything, except the \r\nscenes themselves, are fixed. There is a whole protocol to be followed to \r\nplay a match, and even the number of separated and mixed scenes is set in \r\nstone.

Then the scene is replayed, from the point of view of one of the characters.  You can replay several times, from several POVs.\r\n\r\n Make sure the scene is such that the relationships between the characters \r\nallow for clear POVs.

The name is based on a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, called Traumnovelle, in which a series of characters sequentially\r\nbed each other, from first to last back to first.\r\n\r\n The format is fairly simple: we play scenes in which at every scene switch,\r\nthe `oldest` character disappears and a new scene is played with the remaining\r\ncharacter, and a new one.  The form ends when the circle closes and the last\r\nand first characters do a scene.  Obviously, there is no need for all characters\r\nto bed each other!\r\n\r\n Switching scenes is done by tagging out (like in  Freeze Tag ).

One player give the suggestions (e.g. \nlet`s find a talking crab).  The other player either accepts the offer, and both play accordingly, or refuses the offer.  When an offer is refused the first \nplayer needs to make a better offer.\n\n Notes \n\nThis is a bit controversial in the sense that players may object to refusing\noffers; after all, we teach players to accept offers.  \nExplain that the goal\nof this exercise is twofold:\n teach players to drop their own ideas (see  Chivalry ) and happily change course in their story\n teach players which offers are `fun` and which ones are not.  The player \naccepting or refusing the offers should accept any offer that `feels good` or \nthat advances the story, and only reject offers that don`t sound like fun or don`t seem to offer any potential for an interesting story.\n\n\nSee  Ding and  Yes Lets - or Rather Not for similar exercises.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Letter Number Name ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Letter Number Name \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nWarm-up game that`s also good to get to know each other`s names. \n\n\nEveryone in a big circle. You start by `giving` your neighbor your name.  Just\nlift your right arm and call your name to your neighbor.  He does the same \nto his neighbor, and names run around the circle.\n\n\nThen do the same with the letters of the alphabet.  Give an `a` to \nyour neighbor, making a \n`giving` gesture with your right hand.  Your \nneighbor continues by passing a `b` to his neighbor, and so on.\n\n\nDitto with the numbers 1 to 9.  Use another gesture, e.g. pass the number \nby tipping your right foot in the direction of your neighbor.\n\n\nWhen everyone`s got this, try all of this at the same time.  Start by passing \nyour name, and as soon as the name thing has advanced 2 or 3 players across\nthe circle, set a letter thing in motion, and then a number thing.  If you\nhave enough players, just mix and match.\n\n Notes \n\nPay attention to how much gets lost - does everything you set in motion\neventually get back to you or not?  You can coach players by saying they\nonly need to pay attention to what their neighbor does, not what`s going on\nelsewhere in the circle.\n\n Variations \n\nFeel free to pass other things, each with it`s own gesture.

Then ask them to blank their mind, to try and think\r\nabout nothing at all.  Let them do this for 2 minutes or so.  While they do so,\r\nmake sure to walk around, to make some minor noise (blow your nose, clear your \r\nthroat, walk around) - but don`t overdo this.  If you can hear cars drive by\r\nin the street, or other people in the \r\nbuilding, or hear birds sing then you \r\ndon`t even have to make a noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen ask the players who managed to think about absolutely nothing at all.\r\nAsk those who say they did whether they heard the birds, the cards, you clearing\r\nyour throat.  If they did, weren`t they thinking about that, then?\r\n\r\n Now ask the players to close their eyes, and to keep repeating the sound \r\n`mihad` in their heads.  Have them do this for about 3 minutes.  Then ask \r\nthem again who thought about nothing but `mihad`.  If they are honest they\r\nshould all admit they thought of all kinds of stuff.\r\n\r\n The point is that our minds just never stop working.  Even if you`re trying\r\nto concentrate on a repeating sound in your head - a Mantra - your mind will\r\nstill wander.\r\n\r\n We are all capable of thinking about several things at a time, some people\r\ncan keep up to 7 lines of thought going in their minds.  Who has never driven\r\na car, being perfectly concentrated on the traffic, without thinking about\r\nwork, the \r\ngroceries, the kids ?\r\n\r\n You can use this exercise to show students they never need to be afraid\r\nof a brain freeze - our brains manage to come up with so many things all\r\nthe time - if\r\nyou let them.\r\n\r\n Mantras are used as a technique for (Transcendental and other) meditation. \r\nThe idea is to keep the most active part of your consciousness busy, and at\r\nthe same time let unconscious processes and lines of thought surface.  This\r\nis similar to what happens in our dreams, but it has been proven (we`ve been\r\ntold) that these meditation techniques can be more relaxing or cleansing than\r\nsleep.  Don`t take our word for that, though.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nYou can choose any gobbledygook word for a mantra for this exercise, as long\r\nas it`s not an existing word (don`t use `banana`) or strongly resembles an\r\nexisting word (`banano` wouldn`t do either) - that could trigger people to \r\nthink about monkeys, or a jungle, or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n See also  Mantra for examples how you might use Mantras to play\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Marriage Counsel Endowment ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Marriage Counsel Endowment \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n\r\nOne player is sent out of the room while the host gets 2 relationship problems from the audience.\n\r\n2 other players play a couple with these problems, and player one is the therapist.  \r\nPlayers need \nto get the therapist to figure out what the relationship problems are.\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Marshmallow Mania ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Marshmallow Mania \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nImprovise a scene in which the audience is not supposed to laugh.

The master will ask the servant for something simple.  The servant always blocks the question, and \nexplains why this should not be possible.  The master always accepts this, and \nasks for something else (which turns out to be impossible as well).  Every time\nthe servant has to explain why this should not be possible, the situation gets worse, until the whole thing turns out to be a disaster.\n\n An example:\n Perkins, get me a glass of brandy.\n Yes sir.  Oh, sir, that won`t be possible sir, we`re out of brandy.\n Well, get me a glas of whisky, then.\n Yes sir.  Ah, sir, um, we`re out of whisky too, sir.\n Oh?  Well get my any kind of alcohol, then.\n Ah sir, we`re out of alcohol sir.\n Perkins, have you been drinking again?\n Well, the \nstaff had a little party last night, sir.\n I see.  Well get me a glass of water from the kitchen then.\n Yes sir.  Ah, sir, the water pipes are bust sir, sorry.\n Well, get me some water from the pond then.\n Ah, yes, sir, uh, sorry sir, the pond is dry, sir.\n\n\nAnd so on, until it turns out that the staff had a little party, accidentily set\nthe kitchen on fire, used the water from the pond to fight the fire, and so on. Eventually, the only room still standing is the master`s study, the rest of the\ncastle has burnt down and all staff are dead.  And all this for a perfectly \nlogical explanation.\n\n The idea is for the servant to connect all elements the master brings\nup, into one and the same disaster.

Comparable to  Gorilla Theatre , but a bit easier, \r\nand can be played with a fairly large number of players (\nup to 20), and \r\n2 directors. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of all players are on a big score board. The directors choose for \r\nevery game the appropriate number of players, perhaps by fishing name tags \r\nout of a hat. The directors explain the improv game to be played, perhaps ask the audience for\r\n suggestions, direct and correct the scene. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter each scene or game the audience decides, by cheering or applause how many \r\npoints the scene should be awarded. Each player gets as many points as \r\nthe scene he or she played in was awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce everyone has played in a scene, the players with the lowest score drop \r\noff, and the whole thing starts again. The directors ensure that (certainly\r\n with large groups of players) that there are more group-games at the\r\n start of the evening, and more 2-person scenes or even monologues toward \r\nthe end of the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a fun format that can be played with mixed bunches of experienced \r\nand not-so-\nexperienced players. Since players are immediately judged, it \r\nis perfectly possible to pitch a start player after the first round. \r\nSince this system is basically somewhat unfair, and everybody knows this,\r\n no one should take elimination too personal (well, that`s the idea anyway).\r\n\r\n For beginners it`s a nice format, as the directors will correct obvious\r\n blunders. And since all players in a scene get the same score, this format\r\n limits competition between players in a scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nThe (copyrighted) format is attributed to  Keith Johnstone , and also described in his book  Impro for Storytellers .\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Millipede ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Millipede \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nGreat fun but be careful not to hurt each other.

Once the routine is established, they both start to walk to the center of the circle and stop when they are close enough to touch, still mirroring each other. All the players should reach the center of the circle at the same time.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n Participants can mirror who ever they want to in the circle and shouldn't let the person they're mirroring guess that they are being mirrored.\r\n Alternatively, one player gets out of the room and waits outside while somebody is designated in the circle to be copied by all the other members of the circle. The player waiting outside is called back in and has to guess, by observing the circle, who is \noriginating the movements that everyone else is copying.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Montage ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Montage \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is just a name for the most generic form of  Long Form : a Montage\nis just a series of scenes, connected or not.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" More or Less ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t More or Less \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\nThis is a \nnice improv show format.\r\n\r\nAny number of players from 5 upwards.

After a couple of minutes the director\r\nasks the audience: more or less.  Audience yells their preference, and if More \r\nsounds loudest, scene is continued.  If audience yells Less then the scene is \r\nnot continued and another player presents another scene.\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nOriginated at the Loose Moose Theatre in\r\nCalgary, Canada.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Motel ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Motel \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis is another variation on  the classic  Harold .  The twist (and hence the title): all scenes happen in the same motel room.\r\n\r\n Suggestion can be anything, and the opening can be a free association.  After the 3 first beats of 3 story lines are played.  Anything goes, but the scenes all happen in the same motel room.

Here is how it works.\r\n\r\nPlayers call for new characters, by giving them names that refer to character\r\nor physical traits.  Things like: Ah, here comes mr. Bad Irish Accent;  I think\r\nwe need Mrs. Pathological Liar for this one; Dear dear, if that isn`t Sir \r\nEats-People.  And so on.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to challenge the other players with weird and \r\nunexpected suggestions,\r\nand forcing htem to come up with an extravagant character right away.  In a\r\nsense this is really institutionalised  Pimping .

It is inspired by the Cluedo board game.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is a gathering of many characters.  Audience may provide the reason for the gathering, and audience suggestions may be used to give each player a character. One character is destined to be killed; the other characters should have reasons to kill the victim; again audience suggestions may be used for that, or you let the motives evolve as the performance develops.  One player is set aside to play the detective; alternatively a second player may become the detective's sidekick.  Alternatively, the script for the gathering and a description of the characters are \nprepared before the show.\r\n\r\n The format starts with the gathering, at one point lights go out and when they come up again, the victim is dead.  \r\n\r\n Next, the detective(s) interview each of the characters (separately, though other characters may interfere during the questioning).  Each character  should make themselves suspect, at the same time of course denying every involvement in the murder.  The characters may try and implicate other characters.  Events discovered during the interviews may be played as flashbacks.\r\n\r\n After every character has been interviewed, the detective calls all characters together, Hercule Poirot style, and discusses the motives for each character.  The last character discussed is tagged as the killer.\r\n\r\n Then lights go out, and the opening scene is re-played, lights go out, come up again, and we finally see the murder happening, by the designated killer, in slow motion.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Musical Fairy Tale ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Musical Fairy Tale \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\nMusical Fairy Tale requires 5-7 players, plus a musician.

If at any point the bottle is dropped, both the thrower\nand the receiver lie down on the floor and shout `My Fault` as loud as possible.  After than, one of them picks up the bottle and the game continues.\n\nSide coaching: tell the players to take risks, to try and make eye contact with a player \nat the other side of the room.\n\n Variations \n\n Tell the players the bottle is red hot, and they need to throw it as fast as possible,\nor they`ll burn their hand.\n The bottle becomes extremely light, or extremely heavy, and the \nplayers act accordingly.\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Mystery Word ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Mystery Word \r\n\t                  \r\n                        This is a great exercise for listening skills and co-operation.

First player builds an object,\r\nas precise and careful as possible, then hands it over to the other.  Second\r\nplayer accepts the object, being as truthfull to what the first player built\r\nas possible.  After having acknowledged this, player 2 starts morphing the\r\nobject into something else.  This can be done by bending, breaking, twisting,\r\nextending, shrinking,\n you name it.

(Or get an object from the audience in a show) \nThat object is your suggestion. \n One at a time, three members (or how ever many you decide) do a short \nmonologue off  that object. One person starts and when they are done, \nthey leave the object on the chair for the next person. Whoever is inspired\njumps up next adding their part of the story/situation from another character`s\n point of view. and the third person completes the cycle. \n This exercise is extremely character based. The first character sets \nthe story in motion \nand then the other two people find a way to be \nanother interesting character that will accept and heighten the first \ninitiation. The challenge is to not be totally predictable with the follow up \ncharacter choices (avoid immediately choosing to be the spouse when you could \nbe that person`s mailman...or manicurist instead). At the same time you still \nwant to support the story line and justify what the previous characters have \nalready established. The characters don`t have to know each other, but they \nmust have connections (if only through the object).\n\n This exercise helps:\n listening (you must listen to the characters before you to know how you can fit into the story/situation and justify it.)\n character work \n  Truthfulness (try not to focus `just` on the object.

That implies that any question should be giving information, and should\r\nbe (implicitly) advancing on the information already available.  Evidently,\r\nthe next player should implicitly accept any information that was given\r\nin the previous \nquestion(s).\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Open Offer ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Open Offer \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nOne player starts a scene by making an offer that is not `complete`, in the\r\nsense that it is vague enough not to define the who/what/where right away.\r\nAnother player steps in and completes the  Platform .\r\n\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nAlthough in performance we probably want to establish our  Platform as \r\nearly as possible, this game teaches improv players how to quickly build platforms as a group or a team.  \r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Open Your Hand ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Open Your Hand \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nLet the players walk around the room leisurely.  Then ask them to stop, open \ntheir hands, and let something fall out of the sky, right into their hands.\nLet them name the object in their hands, set it aside, move on and open their\nhands again.\n\n Notes \n\nSome people find this a bit of a scary game, as if they are afraid they are \nnot going to come up with anything.  Explain that there are no wrong \nanswers.\n\n Some players will complain that everything that falls out of the sky\nis a dead bird (or whatever).  Explain to them that this is fine too.  Most \nplayers, if reassured that they really can`t go wrong, move on to other stuff\nafter 10 dead birds or so.\n\n Variations \n\nYou can tell players they can vary the way they extend their hands or hand.\nThey can hold hands in front of them, above their head or close to the ground.\nSee if different stuff shows up.\n\n\nA slightly less difficult version of this game can be done by having players \nput their hands in their pockets and take something out.  Make sure they all\ngot pockets if you want to play this game.  This version is slightly \neasier, as anything in their pockets, like dust, or the way the fabric feels, \ncan trigger and idea; when holding your hands out there is very little to\ntrigger an idea.\n\n Origin \n\n Keith Johnstone describes similar games in his book  Impro .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Opposite Characters ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Opposite Characters \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is basically the opposite to  Imitate : for the shopkeeper, rather \nthan imitating the customer`s character, try and build a totally opposite character.\n\n As a side coaching, point players to the following character treats:\n voice (loud/soft/harsh ? intonation?)\n  Status (high/low?)\n Age?

The scene is starting by stating who they are, or where they are.\nExample: \"We-are-on-a-sunny-beach\".  The players then actually play that, and build a story, word at a time,\nand actually playing the story at the same time.\n\n For example: \"We-see-a-dead-whale\"; the players \nshould actually see the whale, and do something with it.\nThere is no need to `say` everything before doing it ( use our motto: Play it, don`t say it).\n\n Notes \n\nPlayers have an adventure together; the story needs to happen to both of them, they are not to play\nagainst each other.\n\n\n\nAs many players tend to verbosity, use a director that `cuts` the scene and tells the players what to do. \nExample: \"Give the whale mouth-to-mouth\".\n\n Variations \n\nAllow a third character to enter the scene, playing against the two others.  Now the lines are done word per\nword, by 3 players, but we have 2 characters.  This gets extremely silly/messy - to create some order out \nof this chaos make sure the third player (i.e. the second character) has a different voice (different accent\nor pitch).

Justification should be placed on both the narrator and the pop-up actors at various times throughout the story.\r\n You can either have the whole story \"told\" by the narrator, or use the flip-of-the-page as your  Edit mechanism.  In the latter case, once the whole scene has popped-up, a player may start playing, talking, walking around.\r\n Variations  \r\n Remember that players may as well pop up as props; this may be a good way to do some  Object Work.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Popcorn ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Popcorn \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nEveryone finds themselves a nice spot, and squat down.  The teacher now talks the \ngroup through this exercise.   Everyone is a piece of corn, the floor is a big\npan, and we`re going to make popcorn.  We slowly start heating the pan; as the pan gets \nhotter, corn starts to `pop`.  A player can `pop` by jumping up, clapping hands above \ntheir head, and saying `pop`.\n\nMake sure the `popping` starts \ngradually, `popping` is a group thing, and in the end, \n`popping` should stop.\n\n Variations \n\nForget to take the pan off the fireplace, and have the popcorn start charring.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Presents ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Presents \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nGreat warm-up exercise that helps you blank your mind.  Good for control freaks.\n\n\nPlayers stand in pairs and give each other presents.  To give a present, you\njust open your arms/hands to indicate you`re holding something.  Don`t try\nto think about what you`re holding, but give it to your companion.\n\n \nUpon receiving the present, you give it a name, the first thing that comes to\nmind.  You say something like `Oh, thanks, a little dead bird`.  You promptly\nignore your present and return something else to your companion.\n\n\nThis game works best if it`s played fast, so players really don`t have the \ntime to preconceive.  It`s also nice and positive, as everybody is always \nextremely happy with their presents, no matter what they are.\n\nn\nIf players complain they always receive the same present (\"It`s always a book\")\ntell them this is quite ok - they should be happy to receive so many books.  See\nalso  Spontaneity for related games.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Press Conference ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Press Conference \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis is a verbal improv game, played with 3 to 8 players.  One player leaves the room, while the audience provides the name of a famous or historical person.  The `absent` player will give a \r\npress conference, but he does not know who he is.  The other players are\r\njournalists, whose questions should provide indications to who the \r\nmystery guest might be.\r\n\r\n Game ends when our player guesses who he is.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThe `journalists` should really play journalist characters.  They can take\r\nphotographs, or have a fight about who gets to ask the next question.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\nInstead of a famous or historical person, choose an expert.  The game is over when the `expert` figures \nout what he or she is expert in.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Primal Screams ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Primal Screams \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAll players in a circle.  On player steps into the circle, making a big\ngesture and a loud sound.  Player then steps back, and the rest of the \ncircle imitates the sound and gesture.\n\n\nTry and do this with open sounds, as loud as possible.  As  Keith Johnstone says: \"Yelling `en masse` is good for the soul\".\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Props ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Props \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nIn this game the players need to come up with an original/funny use of a prop.  \nThey cannot use the prop the way it is supposed to be used for, obviously.\n\n Notes \n\nYou could really use any object as if it were a cell phone, but that is not\nthe idea of the exercise.  Look at the object (or it`s parts) and see what\ninspires you.  We once saw a player, given a chair, who turned into a prisoner.\nThe back of the chair became the bars of this cell.\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Protest Song ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Protest Song \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nAsk the audience for something that pisses them off.

The other 2 players are the puppet masters, that\nwill provide the movements for the puppets.\n\n Variations \n\nSome groups use audience members to play the puppets or the puppet masters.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Rash ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Rash \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nnMake sure you have as many pieces of paper as there are players.  Write `cure`\non all but one, and a disease (like `rash`) on one.  Each player draws a\npiece of paper, but no-one knows who`s got the disease.  Then find the disease \nand cure it.\n\n Variations \n\nHave one `cure` and all the others the same disease.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Real Estate Broker ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Real Estate Broker \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nOne player is a real estate broker and shows a second player (or multiple\r\nplayers) around a space, given by the audience/trainer.  Each player can create\r\nwhatever they wish in the space, and questions are not allowed.  Any object \r\ncreated should be justified (by the broker or by the others).

All players in a circle. Players\ncan throw a `clap` to any other player by pushing their hands \ntogether in\nfront of their chest (like a praying gesture), and then pushing both hands\ntowards the receiving player, opening up their arms as they do so.  Sending\na `clap` makes a `Whoof` sound; receiving a clap makes a sucking sound.\n\n\nThe receiver receives the clap by making the inverse gesture, and uttering\na sucking sound.\n\n\nOnce a clap is received, the player to the right of the receiver sends a new\nclap to any other player.  And so one.\n\n\nOnce everyone`s got it, switch to left-hand side player of the receiver to send\nthe next clap.\n\n Variations \n\nIf all players are really concentrating, and this game goes particularly well,\ntry `skipping` a neighbor.  E.g. the second player to the left of the receiver\nsends the next clap.\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Remote Control ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Remote Control \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n Players in pairs.  One player,  uses her voice and body to produce any sound she wishes. The other player interprets those sounds through movements, acting in synchronization with the first player's \"sound track\". Exchange roles after a while.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\nThe player doing the movement controls the player doing the sounds.\r\n Alternatively, each player leads in turn without a predefined order.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Repair Shop ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Repair Shop \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nOne player leaves the stage (or gets a headphone).\nAudience provides an object, and something not-so-obvious that is wrong with \nthe object.  Example: an airliner for \nwhich the keys to open the door have been\nlost.  In the game the player that is `it` needs to solve the problem, without\nknowing what the problem is.  As soon as she finds out the game is over.\n\n Variations \n\nBring the object back to the shop where it was purchased.  Shopkeeper should give hints as to what the object is.\n\nInstead of an object, use an animal that is sick, dead or does not do what\nwas promised.  Like a parrot that refuse to speak - Also known as Veterinarian Endowment. .\n Invert it - have the shopkeeper guess what it is.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Repeater ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Repeater \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nListening exercise.

Play music, and have the players dance around the chairs.  When the music stops, everyone should find a chair to sit on.  The player that doesn`t find a chair needs to find some other way to get his/her feet off the ground.\r\n\r\nRemove a chair and repeat.  In the end, all players will have to find a way to not to \r\ntouch the ground, by climbing and clinging on to each other.  Make sure you got sturdy \r\nchairs; we`ve known chairs to collapse under the weight of 10 players ...\r\n\r\nIt`s important not to side coach - the group needs to figure out themselves how to solve \r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Reverse Trivial Pursuit ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Reverse Trivial Pursuit \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \nLike most of the games in the  Verbal wit category, no exactly theater, but fun if played well.\n\n\n\nAsk the audience for statements or facts, \nto which the players need to come up with the funniest question\nto which the statement/fact might be the answer.\n\n Example: \n Statement: \"Green Bananas\"\n Question: \"What is best avoided if you got constipation?\"\n  \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Rhymes ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Rhymes \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nScene played in verses.  The idea is that the first player offers a line, and \nthe second player rhymes to that.  Then the second player offers another line,\nwith which the first player needs to make a rhyme.\n\n\nPlayers that hesitate or forget to rhyme `die` and are replaced by other players.  The idea is to keep the story going, so players that can`t find a good \nrhyme that would advance the story better die than screw up the story.\n\n See also  Verses .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Rituals ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Rituals \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nGet an everyday activity from the audience.

To be used sparingly.\n\n The idea is that any player can stop the scene by yelling freeze, step out of character, and \ndescribe something within the scene, without interrupting what is going on in the scene.  After\nnthe comment, player unfreezes the scene and steps back into character.\n\n Example.  2 players in a scene where a backpacker is looking for a bed at a house where an\nold lady lives.  Backpacker comments on the fact that the house is chock full of stuffed animals,\nan little pictures of backpackers, thereby implying that the old lady kills and stuffs backpackers \n(idea stolen from a short story by Roald Dahl).\n\n See also  Asides for another game with uses a similar technique.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Scene To Music ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Scene To Music \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nA silent scene is played, in which the characters` emotions are controlled \nby the music.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Script Tease ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Script Tease \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nThis is a  Long Form format. Instead of getting suggestions from the audience, a (preferably well known local) writer is invited to provide the first two pages of a non existing novel.  These pages are read to the audience (preferably by the writer herself) and the rest of the story is then improvised.\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nThe format is attributed to the National Theatre of the World in Toronto.  As far as we know the format is copyrighted; you'll need permission to perform it.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Sculptors ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Sculptors \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nWorks best with an even number of players.  Split the group in 2.  \nOne half forms a circle in the middle of the room,\nfacing outwards.  The other half positions themselves, each player in front\nof one of the players in the middle circle.\n\n The middle players are clay, or stone, and the outsiders are sculptors.\nLet each sculptor do something to his lump \nof clay, then make the sculptors \nrotate clockwise.  Everyone now stands in front of someone else`s block of\nstone or lump of clay.  Have them work some more on the sculpture and rotate\nagain.  Repeat till every player is in front of his original piece of stone\nagain.\n\n\nThen ask the sculptors to introduce their work, and give it a name.\n\n\n\n Variations \n\nEach statue or sculpture has a built in voice chip that can utter exactly \none sentence.  Let the sculptors switch on the voice chip at the end of their\nexplanation.\n\n Notes \n\nExcellent exercise to try with a new group to see who is  Mr. Nice Guy .\nPlayers that keep placing the sculptures in positions that are impossible to\nmaintain or physically painful can easily be spotted with this exercise.\n\n\nOther thing to watch for is which players undo the work the previous artists\nmade.  The idea is to build art together, not to destroy previously done work\nin order to push your own ideas.  Make this clear by asking the sculptors, \nwhen\nthey`re in front of their original work again, to what extent the works still\nlooks anything like what they started with.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Seven Up ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Seven Up \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \nEveryone in a circle, start counting to 7 while waving right arm up and down\nto the same\nrhythm you`re counting. After 7 switch to the other arm, then the right\nleg, then the other leg.  At the end of the last\nleg of 7 go back to the original arm and do the same thing counting to 6,\nand so on down to 1-1-1-1. \n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Shootout ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Shootout \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\nExcellent game to get to know each other`s names.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody`s a cowboy or cowgirl, you get them in a circle and ask them to test their\r\nrevolvers. Have them shoot up in air, not at each other (yet).  Then ask the group to\r\nconcentrate; when everybody`s quiet, call someone`s name.  That person needs to drop \r\nto the floor as fast as he can.  His neighbors take a shot a him; if he`s not down \nr\nfast enough, he dies (making grueling sounds).  If he`s down before a gun is fired, the\r\nneighbor who fired last dies.\r\n\r\n \r\nInsist that for every shot there should\r\nbe at least one victim.  If`s there`s any confusion about who shot first, they should all\r\nspontaneously die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeat till only 2 players are alive.  Place those 2 back to back in the middle of the \r\nroom, and give them a sign to start walking away from each other.  When they hear you \r\ndrop a coin (or a key ring, or whatever) they turn around as fast as \r\nthey can and shoot the other.  \r\nAgain, at least one victim, and if they`re not sure who shot first they should both \r\ngladly die.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\nA shot can only be fired after a player has made a 360 degree spin.\r\n\r\n Another variation is to have players walk around.  Whoever gets caught in cross fire is dead.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThis is really a game about  Chivalry and not about winning.  Use this game early\r\nin a \nworkshop to spot the students that stubbornly refuse to be shot and correct them.\r\nYou could consider your moment of death you moment of glory - show off how willing you are to accept you own death,\r\nand die with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Sideways ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Sideways \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nIn this game we play a scene, in which the back wall is the `floor`, and \nthe floor is a wall.  So, if you are `standing` in the scene, you would be\nlying on the floor, and if you`re lying down, you`d really be standing \nagainst the back wall.\n\n\nThis setup allows players to so all kinds of weird things, like defying gravity,\nor become a bat that`s hanging upside down off the wall. \n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Silly Stinky Sexy ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Silly Stinky Sexy \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n4 players.

The remaining 4 players each get one of the following from the audience:\r\n Something old\r\n Something new\r\n Something borrowed\r\n Something blue\r\n The idea is that player number 5, the Bride, needs to guess each of the 4 players items. Game ends when all 4 items have been guessed.\r\n\r\nThe players need to provide hints to the bride, but they cannot explicitly tell the bride what they are or what they have. Similar in essence to  The Party .\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nWorks best if players help the bride by providing hints as to the other characters items. The players can chose to \"be\" the item or simply have the item and try and present it to the bride only dropping hints. One example; Something old = Abacus, Something new = IPhone (new at time of writing), Something borrowed = \nChainsaw, Something blue = Blue Whale.

The whole point of the tool is to provide a model for a well-constructed story with a beginning that establishes a routine, an event that breaks the routine, a middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine, a climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion, and the resolution. It goes like:\r\n\r\n Once upon a time...\r\n\r\n Every day...\r\n\r\n But, one day...\r\n\r\n Because of that...\r\n\r\n Because of that...\r\n\r\n Because of that...\r\n\r\nn Until, finally...\r\n\r\n And, ever since then...\r\n\r\n And, here's how the lines correlate to the different sections of a  well-constructed story:\r\n \r\n The Beginning that establishes the routine:  Once upon a time...  Every day...\r\n \r\n The Event that breaks the routine: But, one day...\r\n \r\n The Middle that shows the consequences of having broken the routine: Because of that... \r\nBecause of that... \r\nBecause of that...  The Climax that sets the resolution to the story in motion:\r\nUntil, finally...\r\n \r\n The Resolution\r\nAnd, ever since then...\r\n\r\n\r\n This little structure teaches performers to advance a story by changing \r\nthings.  There are hundreds of variations known to this, one of which we`ll \r\npresent here as well:\r\n The balance: Once upon a time ... \tand every day ...\r\n\r\n The un-balance: But then one day ... \r\n\r\n The quest for a \nresolution: ... and because of that ... and so ... until finally ....\r\n\r\n The new balance: ... and ever since that day ....\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nThe original story spine was created by Kenn Adams who also kindly offered the summary text above to this site.

The sculpture is finished when all of the players touch someone else (so all are connected to the sculpture).  The artists cannot `push` the clay into position - they need to `pull` parts of the clay into position without actually pulling.  `Pulling` is\ndone by touching a body part with an open hand, and then moving the hand about.  They `clay` players need to `follow` the moving open hands.\n\n\nAs soon as the sculpture is finished, the sculptors moves away, and re-build the \nstatue, themselves now becoming clay.  The (original) clay players keep their eyes closed.  As soon as the imitation \nsculpture is finished, the clay players, eyes still closed, try to find `themselves` \nin the imitation.  When everybody has found themselves \nthe game is over, and \nthe clay players assess to what extent they found `themselves` and to what extent the imitation is exact.\n\n\n\n\n Origin \n\nDescribed in  Augusto Boal `s  Games for Actors and Non-actors .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Switch Gibberish ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Switch Gibberish \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n Jabbertalk exercise: let a player tell a store.

As a format, it can be used for  Short Form performances as well as for  Long Form work.  \r\n\r\n The premise is simple:  Transitions between scenes are made by tagging out (a) player; the other player(s) remain in the scene and the person who tagged joins in, starting a scene at a different time and/or location.\r\n\r\n TagOuts as a format are described in  Art by Committee, and the book has good examples on the video included.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" TellTales ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t TellTales \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n\nIn this format a cast of five gets one ask-for each at the top of the show, and then each person is free \nto play solo scenes with invisible characters, addressing the audience, musing to themselves, speaking \non the telephone, just being physical and so on until another player enters, at which point they have to \nleave.

One player on a chair, up to 5 other players sit in front of her.\nThe player on the chair starts by taking something out of a big mimed bag.  She holds the object in front of her and\nnames the object - anything that comes to mind is just fine (see  Warehouse ,\n  Open Your Hand or  Presents ).\n\n\n\nThe other players start asking the middle player questions about the object, why she has it, what it might mean to her.\nAfter a few questions, she is \nasked to take another object from the bag - again, this can be anything and need not be \nrelated to the first object that came up.  This prompts more questions, and more objects.  \n\n\n\nContinue until we know the character that is sitting on the chair.\n\n Notes \n\nThe idea of the exercise is to construct the character as a group.  Both objects, questions and answers to the questions\nwill provide cues to who the person on the chair might be.  Avoid very leading questions, although any element in the \nquestions should probably be accepted.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the person on the chair has an idea of who she might be, what her state of mind might be, how old she might be,\nwhat her  Status might be,\n she should start showing these qualities, until she really `becomes` the character.

Classic example is the following: \"After \nfixing the roof, Roger\ndecided to clean the house, including the cage of Mary`s gerbil.  He put the animal in a frying pan, from which it escaped to the roof, where it got stuck in some fresh tar.  Roger put it back\nin it`s cage, where it got smothered by the fresh woodchips.  Roger tried to use a solvent to \nclean the creature, but the solvent fumes cause the creature to die of a cardiac arrest.  At that\npoint Mary walks in\".  \n\n\n This is when \nthe scene starts: Roger needs to explain what happens, but as soon as the audience\nstarts laughing Roger is replaced by another player who gets a new shot.

After the initiator has spoken his first line, the joiner repeats exactly what the initiator said. Then we interrupt.\r\n\r\n Ask the joiner what was established prior to the first line, as well as what the first line established.  This slows down the scene so the joiner gets the time to fully grasp what his scene partner has given him. This goes both ways - what did the initiator get from the joiner (non-verbally)?\r\n\r\n Then re-run the start of the scene and let it develop.\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Theatresports ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Theatresports \r\n\t                  \r\n                         Description \r\n\r\n\r\nTheatre Sports is really a collection of formats.  We`ll summarize the general\r\n rules, and then describe the variations for the different sub-formats:\r\n\r\nThe game is introduced by an MC, who does a warm-up and then introduces the \r\njudges and the 2 teams\r\n \r\nThe game is lead by judges \r\n\r\nEach game has a fixed duration \r\n\r\nA  toss decides which team starts with a  challenge\r\n \r\nChallengers go first. Possible challenges are the classic games, but anything\r\n goes. One might challenge the other team to play the dullest scene possible.\r\n \r\nTeams can protest or baulk at a challenge. The judges may accept the baulk, \r\nin which case the challengers need to come up with a new challenge. Reason \r\nfor baulking at a challenge might be \"we`ve already done this game tonight\".\r\n \r\nThe judges carry a horn, which they use to issue a warning for boring. After \r\na warning the scene should be concluded ASAP. \r\n\r\nJudges can issue penalties, for e.g. \r\nobscenities, smart-assing or whatever.\r\n A punished player gets a basket over his head for a number of minutes\r\n \r\nScenes must end on time; the judges indicate the time, and warn the players\r\n e.g. when they got 30 seconds left. Or they honk a warning for boring, \r\nafter which the scene must end. \r\n\r\nAfter each challenge (played by both teams) the audience decided by means\r\n of cheering, yelling of applause which team won, as interpreted by the\r\n judges. Winners get 5 points, losers get nothing. \r\n\r\nThe whole show lasts about 45 minutes. \r\n Variations \r\n\r\nSome troupes let the judges issue the challenges.  \r\nOther troupes allow the winning team a free scene.\r\n \r\nDanish variety: in this format there is only one judge, called an Ombuds. \r\nThe Ombuds is both Commentator, MC and scorekeeper.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis format is quite often played with props, in a décor. Sound and light \r\neffects are also used. The Danish version is a bit simpler, and can be used \r\nto play with beginners. \r\n\r\nSome \r\ntroupes start an evening off with a 20-minute Danish game, and then \r\nplay a 45-minute full version after the intermission.\r\n\r\nTheatre sports are played all over the world, and teams from different \r\ncities and troupes quite often meet in competition.\r\n\r\n Origin \r\n\r\nTheatresports is a registered trademark by  Keith Johnstone .

A second player jumps in, saying \"Let`s ...\"\r\n do something else, to advance the group activity.  Both players say \"Yes, let`s do that\" and start doing whatever suggested.\r\nThird player jumps in, suggests what to do, and again all players loudly agree to do it, and actually do it.

E.g. if player 1 is cutting someone`s hair, when asked what he`s doing he might say \"I`m reading the newspaper\".\n\n\nFirst player moves away, and the second player starts miming the activity stated by the previous player.  A third player comes up to player 2, asks what he is doing, and so on.\n\n\n\nPlay until everyone has mimed something, and has answered the question.\n\n Variations \n\nYou can also play this at super high speed, with 2 players.  We mean super-super\nhigh speed.  As soon as one of the players says ummm, hesitates, or uses an \nnoffer that was used before in that session, that player is replaced.  Great\nfor warm-up and energy!\n\n Notes \n\nOther dissociation games are  Malapropism and  Dissociation .\n\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" What Has Changed ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t What Has Changed \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nPlayed in pairs.

You may want to ask players what\ntriggered their responses - the answers will probably vary widely.\n\n If you are doing a series of workshops, it may also be interesting to\nplay this game early on, before people know each other, and then again after a\ncouple of weeks, when everyone has gotten to know everyone a bit better.

A\n Wow changes the direction of the Whoosh\n\n`Zap`: instead of passing the Whoosh to your neighbor, it gets\nzapped to the person you point to.  The receiver continues \nwith either a Whoosh to his neighbor, or another Zap to \nanother person.  A Wow after a Zap returns to the Zapper.\n\n`Groooooooovelicious`: for this one the whole group bends down and \nup again in a kinda groovy way, all saying Groooooooovelicious.\nAfterwards, the person who started the Groovelicious sets the Whoosh\nin motion again, in any direction.\n\n`Freakout`: indicated by waving both hands in the air.  Everybody starts \nscreaming and moves to the center of the circle.  When everybody`s freaked \nout a new circle is formed, and the starter of the Freakout sets the Whoosh \nin motion again (or Zaps, or does a Grooooooovelicious).\n\n Variations \nYou can invent other \nsounds and gestures.  You might replace Whoosh by a kind\nof Vroom-Vroom, as is you`re in a car, and replace Wow by the sounds of brakes \n(`iiiii`) etc.\n\nAlso known as Zip Zap Zoop.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Without Sound ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Without Sound \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nA scene in played, in which no talk of no sounds are allowed.\n\n See also  Without Words\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Without Words ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Without Words \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nA scene is played, in which the players are not allowed to talk.

End of a sentence can be indicates by a player saying `period`, although that is not necessary.\n\n Notes \n\nThis is more difficult than it sounds, especially with newbies.  If you`re working with novice players have\nthem try a familiar story. like Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs first.  Summarize the story before they get\nstarted, to make sure they`re all on the same story.  Don`t be surprised if gagsters manage to smuggle\natomic bombs and crashing aircraft into the story.  Ask the group if they can see/understand the reasons\nwhy their story sucks.\n\nn You can also play this a challenge with newbies: divide the group into 2 circles, and have them compete\neach other - see which group can finish the story first.\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Word Ball ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Word Ball \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nAnother association game.

One player suggests an action.  All players that \r\nlike the action yell `Yes, Let`s do that` and start doing it.  Whoever does\r\nnot like the suggestion steps out sits down.  Game continues till only one\r\nplayer is left.\r\n\r\n Notes \r\n\r\nThis one is a bit controversial as players will object that (one of) the main\r\nideas in Improv is to accept, and in this game one can reject a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this exercise is that we want our players to be  Mr. Nice Guy - \r\nplayers should try to make their co-players happy.  The problem is to learn what\r\nsuggestions are `good`, which suggestions make our other players happy.  And that`s what we`re trying to learn with this exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttitude is important  for this one:\r\n players should not feel inhibited to step out (i.e. they should not feel\r\nthat they are not accepting\r\n players should not feel rejected when others step out.  Be happy about that - you \r\nare learning which suggestions make others happy!

Everyone raises their right hand. The 1st person points \r\nto someone in the circle with their hand up and says \"you.\" They do the \r\nsame until everyone`s hand is down, and the last person has pointed back to \r\nthe 1st person, thus completing the circle. Important: This is a pattern that \r\nnever changes. Repeat the pattern until it feels comfortable. Then switch \r\nplaces in the circle. Repeat the pattern. Close your eyes, and repeat the \r\npattern.\r\n\r\nWhen everyone is comfortable with that, everyone raises their hand again. \r\nThe same 1st person begins. Name something: a favorite tv show, food, whatever.\r\nDon`t point to the same person that you did last time. Once you feel \r\ncomfortable with this pattern, you begin both. Start with \"you\" and add the \r\nnext level. (Ex: \"you, you, you, string beans, you,\n corn, pizza, you, etc.).\r\n\r\nIf you feel that this is becoming too easy, add a third pattern, switch places in the circle, close your eyes.\r\n\r\n Variations \r\n\r\n More of a challenge, start two patterns, and then add the pattern of pointing \r\nto someone, and saying the name of the person to your right. \r\nOnce that pattern is established, switch places in the circle.\r\n Even more complicated: make another pattern by pointing at players.  Once the pattern is established, players in turn take the \"next\" player's position in the circle; every time someone takes a player's position, that player walks to his next person and takes that position.  Repeat this while passing the other patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" You`re Fired ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t You`re Fired \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\nThis is a scene with 2 players, in which the lines are scripted.  Here`s the script:\n (1) {Knocks on a door}\n (2) Come in.  You know why I called you?\n (1) {Indicates she does not know why}\nn (2) {Hands 1 a (mimed) piece of paper}\n (1) I thought you wouldn`t take that into account?\n (2) You`re fired.\n (1) Fine.  I hated that stupid job anyway.\n\n Have the players play that scene.  They need to stick to the script, but can really do anything as long\nas they don`t add any lines.   It probably won`t be all that interesting. \n\n Then make them replay\nthe scene, but give them a side coaching (which the other player and the audience or the rest of the \ngroup don`t hear).  See if the scenes become any more interesting.\n\nThings you might give a player could be\n You`re nervous, happy, sad, afraid of the other\n The other smells nice/stinks\n You`ve been eating beans/garlic\n You turn into a crow/monkey/cow\n You are in a wheelchair\n You try to make a pass at the other\n Your underwear doesn`t quite fit (too small)\n You are a bit deaf, you can`t find your glasses, you loose a contact, loose your dentures   \n You are a \nkleptomaniac\n Notes \n\nPlayers can do quite a lot without deviating from the script.  They can build/open doors, windows, \ncabinets, make all kinds of noises or faces.\n\n\n\nRemind players they can switch status.  Perhaps they could try and make clear what`s on the note?  Is it\nbad, or petty, or funny, or sad?\n\n Variations \n\nFeel free to come up with a different scene, with different lines.\n\nSee also  Fast Food Stanislawski .\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n             \r\n        "], [" Zapping ", "\r\n     \t      \t\t Zapping \r\n\t                  \r\n                        \n Description \n\n4 players, each chooses a TV format, like the News, a documentary, a Pokemon \nshow, you name it.
